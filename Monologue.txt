UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:

the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map:

In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13

also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map:

In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map:

Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may

also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

good at it? Is she or he happy with his 
or her present work? What is his or 
her working relationship with the 
people around him or her?)

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:

the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map:

In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13

also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may

also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue?

4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.

One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario.

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13

also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample                                 
outline for monologue writing:
