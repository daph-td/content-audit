world, boasts a spectrum of literary
masterpieces that transcended
through time. China, Japan, Korea,
India, Thailand, Indonesia, and the
Philippines all had an impact on the
literature of Asia. Who would not
even know Rabindranath Tagore,
Basho, Confucius, and Jose Rizal? These people are only some of the thousands of literary
writers in the Orient. In this unit, we are going to explore the literature of China, Japan, India,
Thailand, and Indonesia. Part of getting to know their literary treasuries is learning about the
various writers who made their countries well-known all over the world.

Unit Objectives
In this unit, you should be able to:

● describe Asian literature;
● enumerate various Asian writers and their works; and
● explain the themes and features of Asian literature.

Lesson 1: Chinese Literature

Home to 1.3 billion people, China remains to be a country filled
with a long and colorful history where even the oldest of rites
are still being practiced by its citizens up to this day. One of the
significant contributions of China to the world is its rich literary
heritage that dates back in the ancient times. Its literature has
extended from the East to the West and has been revered all
over the world.

Learn about It!

Chinese literature dates back thousands of years, from the
dynastic court poetry to the fiction novel that blossomed
during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) to entertain the
common literate Chinese. The establishment of woodblock
printing during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and the invention
of movable type printing during the Song dynasty (960–1279)
gave rise to written Chinese literature.

Classical Poetry

The Book of Changes is one of the most important classical
texts in Chinese literature. It is a book of divination based on
eight trigrams, which existed during the Zhou dynasty. The
writers of the Warring States period attempted to explain the
world and its moral principles through the commentaries
found in additional sections of the text.

The Classic of Poetry is the earliest collection of poetry, consisting of 305 poems that included
folk and festival songs, hymns, and eulogies. The collection of documents and speeches
written by rulers and officials of Zhou period is called the Classic of History. The Classic of Rites
is a collection of texts that describes ancient rites and court ceremonies during the Zhou
dynasty. It was written during the Warring States period. The Spring and Autumn Annals is a
chronological history of the state of Lu. It contains monthly narrations of important events
during the rule of the twelve leaders of Lu. The Analects of Confucius is a book of sayings
recorded by his disciples that talks about his teachings on how to live a harmonious life and
how to deal with other people.

Classical poetry reached its peak during the Tang dynasty. The early Tang period was known
for its lushi, consisting of eight lines with five to seven characters in each line. Two
distinguished poets of the period were Li Po (Li Bai), known for the romanticism of his poems,
and Tu Fu, a Confucian moralist.

Take a look at a poem written by Li Po:

Clearing at Dawn
Li Po

The fields are chill, the sparse rain has stopped;
The colors of Spring teem on every side.
With leaping fish the blue pond is full;

With singing thrushes the green boughs droop.
The flowers of the fields have dabbled their powdered cheeks;

The mountain grasses are bent level at the waist.
By the bamboo stream the last fragment of cloud

Blown by the wind slowly scatters away.

Another poetic form that became popular was the ci form, which was first developed during
the Tang dynasty. It then flourished during the Song dynasty, as poets based ci poetry on the
tune of popular songs. The development of Chinese sanqu poetry, a freer form patterned on
dramatic arias, led to the development of vernacular Chinese literature.

Classical Prose

The Spring and Autumn periods contributed significantly to Chinese prose style. Works of
Mencius and Zhuang Zi demonstrated well-reasoned and carefully developed ideas and
showed a remarkable improvement in style. Mencius was noted for his elegant diction, while
Zhuang Zi was revered for his use of metaphorical, anecdotal, and allegorical style.

The Tang period saw the emergence of the neoclassical style of prose, which strongly

6

influenced prose writing for the next years. Han Yu (786–824) was a major essayist who
strongly advocated the return of Confucian orthodoxy. Vernacular fiction became popular
after the 14th century. The greatest 18th century vernacular novel is Dream of the Red
Chamber by Cao Xueqin.

Modern Literature

Modern Chinese literature began in the late Qing period (1895–1911), which was described as
a period of active intellectual pursuits sparked by a nationalistic climate. Translated
Western writings introduced new ideas and cultures, thereby resulting in the flowering of
prose fiction that expressed new social and cultural roles for writers. Chinese fiction became
concerned with social problems, historical upheaval, and changing values. Among the
distinguished writers of the period are:

a. Li Boyuan - He was a writer who used vernacular writing for people who did not
receive classical education. His writings are focused on social and political issues during
the late Qing dynasty as a reflection of the Chinese society of that period.

b. Liu E. - He was a writer, archaeologist, and politician who used symbolism and classical
writing illustrations in his writing. This made his writing more appealing to those who
attained classical education.

c. Zheng Pu - He was a novelist who used symbolism and classical literature illustrations
in his writing. During his time, he was also known as the only author who knew a
different language because he knew the French language.

It was also during the late Qing dynasty that the new “civilized drama” emerged, a hybrid of
Chinese operatic drama and Western-style drama. The New Culture Movement (1917–1923)
saw the vernacular language being widely used and eventually displacing the classical
language in all genres. Among those who popularized vernacular literature was Lu Xun
(1881–1936), considered the founder of modern baihua literature (literature that uses
colloquial language) in China.

With the establishment of the League of Left-Wing writers, Lu Xun and other followers
adopted the ideals of socialist realism, adhering to the principle that art must depict
contemporary events exposing the ills of nonsocialist society. The Maoist Era (1949–1976)
placed the publishing industry and the book distribution system under government control
and implemented strict censorship.

7

Despite the measures to instill literary uniformity, a great number of novels of excellent
quality were produced. These writings became the textbooks on life of the young generation,
for they reflected the historic changes in the lives of Chinese people. The Post-Mao Era
(1976–present) published a large number of prose fiction. The writers protested against and
bemoaned the abuses but also expressed their eagerness to contribute in building a new
Chinese society. Literary outlets were revived to satisfy the increasing appetite of the people.
Literary magazines publishing translations of foreign fiction became very popular to the young
generation. Writers also became freer to write about sensitive matters that do not necessarily
conform to literary conventions. However, one of the struggles of modern writers is the
censorship imposed by the Chinese government on both journalism and literature, as
evidenced by the blocking of certain websites and the banning of some books from being sold
in China.

Lesson 2: Japanese Literature

Japanese literature has landed a special place in the
worldwide literary scene when manga was introduced.
However, Japanese literature has its roots dating back
centuries ago. It has survived various periods and rapid
changes of time. It has come a long a way to become what
we know today.

The literature of Japan presents a rich source of beauty and new ideas highly significant to the
West. The Western discovery of Japanese literature was aided by William George Aston’s A

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



History of Japanese Literature first published in New York in 1899.

Chinese elements are regarded as an integral part of Japanese
literature, just as the literature of Greece and Rome are an
integral part of Western literature. The literary forms of China,
as well as Chinese ideographic forms, are at the root of
Japanese literature.

The Japanese have an extensive literature spanning more than
twelve centuries, which are divided into different periods.

Archaic Period

It was marked by two events that were of prime importance to
the development of literature in Japan:

● Introduction of the art of writing (kanji) from China
Until they became acquainted with the Chinese, the Japanese had no written
characters. Chinese characters were adopted to write Japanese, creating what is known
as the man'yōgana, the earliest form of kana or syllabic writing.

● First propagation of the Buddhist religion
Buddhism gained much greater importance in Japan. It took on the highly aristocratic
and uniquely Japanese form. It was influential in developing the Japanese culture.
Literature during this period was mostly a series of songs and poems about war and
historical incidents, and series of norito or prayers to the gods of the Shinto, Japan’s
indigenous religion predating Buddhism.

Nara Period

Considered as the Golden Age of Poetry, it began in 710 AD when Nara was made the seat of
the emperor’s government and ended in 794 AD when the capital was moved to Nagaoka. It
produced two important literary works:

a. Kojiki or Records of Ancient Matters, which contain the early traditions of the Japanese
race, mythology, and legendary history; and

b. Man'yōshū or Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, the oldest extant anthology of

11
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Japanese poetry. Divided into twenty chapters or kan, it contains some 4,500 poems
written over a period of about 440 years and representing the works of several
hundred poets. This collection employs two principal poetic forms: tanka or short
poem, the most universal form of poetry in Japan, made up of 31 syllables arranged in
five lines or units; and choka or long poem, formed with 31 syllables with undefined
length and concluding with an extra seven-syllable line.

The representative prose works during this period are the following:

a. Shoku-Nihongi, a history text;
b. Izumo Fudoki, an ancient record of Izumo; and
c. Nihon Shoki or Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history.

This is a text that shows the history of Japan from its origins until 697 AD.

These texts provide historical accounts of how Japan came to be as a nation.

In the excerpt below, the text narrated the story of Izanagi and Izanami, the gods that
represent masculinity and femininity in the Shinto religion.

Nihon Shoki (excerpt)
The Story of Izanagi and Izanami (Book I)

"The Gods of Heaven addressed Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto, saying: 'There is the
country Toyo-ashi-hara-chi-i-wo-aki no midzu-ho. 'Do ye proceed and bring it into order.' They then
gave them the jewel-spear of Heaven. Hereupon the two
Gods stood on the floating bridge of Heaven, and
plunging down the spear, sought for land. Then upon
stirring the ocean with it, and bringing it up again, the
brine which dripped from the spear-point coagulated
and became an island, which was called Ono-goro-jima.
The two gods descended, dwelt in this island, and
erected there an eight-fathom palace. They also set up
the pillar of Heaven."

Then the male Deity asked the female Deity, saying:—"Is
there anything formed in thy body?" She answered and said:—"My body has a place completely

12

formed, and called the source of femineity." The male god said:—"My body again has a place
completely formed, and called the source of masculinity. I desire to unite my source of masculinity
to thy source of femineity." Having thus spoken, they prepared to go round the pillar of Heaven,
and made a promise, saying:—"Do thou, my younger sister, go round from the left, while I will go
round from the right." Having done so, they went round separately and met, when the female Deity
spoke first, and said:—"How pretty! a lovely youth!" The male Deity then answered and said:—"How
pretty! a lovely maiden!" Finally they became husband and wife.

Heian Period

This period is considered the classical age of Japanese literature. It refers to the period
when Kyoto or Heian-kyō (“City of Peace”) was the real seat of government. Its literature
reflected the pleasure-loving and effeminate but cultured and refined character of the class of
Japanese who produced it. It was largely the work of women; thus, literature during this
period was gentle and domestic.

The popular works produced during this period were the following:

a. Kokinshū (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) is an anthology of the best poems
produced during the previous 150 years; the prose work such as Kokinshū’s preface was
written by Ki No Tsurayuki and which was the start of criticism becoming a distinct form
of Japanese literature; and

b. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is sometimes referred to as the first modern
Japanese novel. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter of the novel.

The Tale of Genji (excerpt)
Murasaki Shikibu

When the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi took place. It was celebrated with a
pomp scarcely inferior to that which adorned the investiture of the first Prince. In fact, all
available treasures were exhausted on the occasion. And again the public manifested its
disapprobation. In the summer of the same year the Kiri-Tsubo-Kôyi became ill, and wished to
retire from the palace. The Emperor, however, who was accustomed to see her indisposed, strove
to induce her to remain. But her illness increased day by day; and she had drooped and pined
away until she was now but a shadow of her former self. She made scarcely any response to the

13
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



affectionate words and expressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed
upon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in the last stage of exhaustion,
and she became so much enfeebled that her mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated
with tears that she might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to devise means to
aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma to be in readiness to convey her to her own
home, but even then he went to her apartment and cried despairingly: "Did not we vow that we
would neither of us be either before or after the other even in travelling the last long journey of
life? And can you find it in your heart to leave me now?" Sadly and tenderly looking up, she thus
replied, with almost failing breath:—

"Since my departure for this dark journey,
Makes you so sad and lonely,

Fain would I stay though weak and weary,
And live for your sake only!"

"Had I but known this before—"

She appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue. Overpowered with grief,
the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany her himself, and at another moment would
have her remain to the end where she then was.

Kamakura-Muromachi Period

It was characterized by a constant state of warfare and turmoil, and the decline of
learning.

The important works of the period are the following:

a. Shin Kokinshū (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems), which is reflective of the
gloom and solitude of the period;

b. Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which tells of the defeat of the Taira by the
Minamoto clan;

c. Gempei Seisuki, which is the history of the rise and fall of the Gen and Hei, two great
noble families who fought for absolute control over Japan during the latter half of the

14
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



12th century, and
d. Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness) by Yoshida Kenko; it is a collection of essays on

various subjects.

The period saw the Buddhist monks as the chief maintainers of learning, the development of
renga or linked verse, and the evolution of Noh drama, which consists of a one-act dance
performed by male actors with extremely slow movements as they chant prose passages and
sing verse sections. Zeami Motokiyo developed the Noh drama to its highest form.

Edo Period

Literature during this period was more voluminous and had a far wider range of subjects. It
was produced by the merchant class and was considered as bawdy and worldly. During the
period, forms of popular drama developed, which later evolved into kabuki, a popular
Japanese theater form consisting of a colorful background, lively and emotional music,
dancing, and exaggerated acting. The period saw the perfection of the haiku, a poem of 17
syllables in three lines of five, seven, five syllables, respectively. A haiku is known to depict the
beauty of nature as seen in the eyes of the writer. Matsuo Bashō, Kobayashi Issa, and Yosa
Buson were notable haiku writers of this period.

The following is a side by side Japanese-English translation of a haiku by Matsuo Bashō. The
translation is by William George Aston.

Frog Poem
Matsuo Bashō

(translated by W.G. Aston)

Japanese English
Furu ike ya

kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto

An ancient pond!
With a sound from the water
Of the frog as it plunges in.

15

Take note that in the original Japanese version, the syllables follow the 5-7-5 pattern in the
respective order of lines. It also shows the emotion and imagery of nature as seen by the
writer. Interpretations may depend on the reader of a haiku.

Other important works of the period are the following: Koshoku ichidai otoko, Tōkaidōchū
Hizakurige, and Oku no Hosomichi. These Japanese works reflect philosophical meditations
toward existence. They highlight Japanese sensibilities when it comes to daily or mundane
experiences.

Meiji Era

The Meiji era saw the reopening of Japan to the West and was a period of rapid
industrialization. It bore witness to the following:

● Fukuzawa Yukichi and Nakae Chōmin wrote enlightenment literature, while
pre-modern popular books portrayed the fast-changing country;

● Haibun, a kind of composition that combines prose and haiku, flourished during this
period;

● Ichiyō Higuchi, a woman writer who wrote short stories on powerless women of this
age, was among the first important writers who emerged during this era;

● Izumi Kyōka, who wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) and The Holy
Man of Mount Koya (1900), is revered for having his own distinctive style that made use
of supernatural elements.

Modern Period

During this time, literature is characterized by the denial of the worth of traditional writings
and by themes of disaffection, loss of purpose, and coping with defeat as a result of World
War II and Japan’s defeat. Osamu Dazai’s novel, The Setting Sun, is one of the stories that
reflect the aftermath of war.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and the 1980s identified with intellectual and moral issues in
their attempt to raise social and political consciousness. These writers include the following:

● Kenzaburō Ōe wrote A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan’s second winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature;

16
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



● Kōbō Abe wrote fantastic novels such as Woman in the Dunes, which won the Yomiuri
Prize for literature in 1962 and was adapted into a film in 1964;

● Shizuko Todo won the 1988 Naoki Prize for Ripening Summer, a story that captures the
complex psychology of modern women;

● Haruki Murakami remains as one of the most popular and controversial of today’s
widely acclaimed Japanese authors.

In the 1980s, Japan established its prominence in the literary scene by producing manga
(comic books). Manga became popular as a material for leisure reading of children and young
adults. Part of the reason why manga was successful was its portrayal of women in the
modern world, and ultimately its representation of a traditional country, such as Japan, which
embraces the challenges of urbanity and the future.

Lesson 3: Indian Literature

India, with its vast number of languages, is teeming with a wide
repository of different literary forms. From its ancient writers
like Kalidasa to its modern-day writers such as Tagore and Roy,
its values, practices, and beauty continue to captivate the
hearts and imagination of the people who had the chance to
read these literary masterpieces.

Indian literature pertains not only to the literature of what we know as India today but also
that of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Historically, these countries were considered one until the
partition of India in 1947, which created India and Pakistan. Then, in 1971, Bangladesh
seceded from Pakistan. In the case of literature, although the countries are no longer one,
their literary tradition is unquestionably united.

19

Today, the constitution of India recognizes 22 official
languages. This includes Sanskrit, which is an ancient
language that was used for writing epics and religious texts.
Though Sanskrit is no longer used by the majority, it is still
considered an important part of Indian cultural heritage that
is at par with the Latin and Greek of the West. While Sanskrit
and other languages developed from Sanskrit are still active
languages in Northern India, most languages used in the
south come from Dravidian, a different language family. An
example of Dravidian language is Tamil. Because of the
contact of Indians with Persians and the rest of the Middle
East, Urdu emerged as a language in the 1500s. As India was
colonized by the British Empire, English became a vital
language. However, only a small percentage of the Indian
population use English because it is mostly accessible through formal education. The Indian
colonial experience affected how writers expressed their sentiments.

Most literary forms and works in Indian literature incorporate philosophical and religious
concepts. Often, these works are viewed as extensions of Hindu teachings. Considered to be
the oldest Hindu writings, the Vedas (meaning “knowledge” in Sanskrit) are a collection of
sacred books written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas:

● Rig Veda (“knowledge of the verses”) - a collection of 1,028 sacred hymns and is divided
into ten books called Mandalas;

● Yajur Veda (“knowledge of the sacrifice”) - a handbook for priests in the performance of
sacrificial rituals;

● Sama Veda (“knowledge of the melodies”) - a collection of chants and melodies drawn
from the Rig Veda and are to be sung during worship; and

● Atharva Veda (“knowledge of the fire priest”) - a collection of charms, spells, and hymns,
largely outside of the scope of worship and Vedic sacrifice.

India prides itself as a civilization that holds some of the world’s oldest epics: the Mahabharata
by Vyasa and Ramayana by Valmiki. Mahabharata narrates an ancient tale of war within a
family caused by a desire for power. The entire text contains 100,000 lines, hence, it is
considered as one of the longest literary masterpieces. It is actually a group of poems in
one. The epic story of the great war between the two branches of the Bharat family comprises

20
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



only about a fifth of the whole work, which runs about 100,000 sloka (lines) or double
octosyllabic couplets and is contained in eighteen books and a supplement. Meanwhile, the
Ramayana takes its story from an episode in the Mahabharata and gives it a romantic
treatment in the form of kavya or court poetry. It centers on the life and adventures of the
couple Ramachandra and Sita. The tale of Savitri is another narrative found in Mahabharata. It
is told to the exiled king of the Pandavas by way of consoling him for the plight of his
much-tried queen, Draupadi. Savitri takes her place alongside the more famous Sita (heroine
of the Ramayana) and the admirable Shakuntala (whose story is also told in the Mahabharata)
as the type of ideal Indian womanhood.

Here is an excerpt of the tale of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata:

Savitri and Satyavan (excerpt)
from the Mahabharata

"Wait my husband," she said, "let me go with
you. To-day I cannot leave you." Satyavan sought
to dissuade her. "You are weak with fasting," he
said, "and the paths are steep and rugged." But
Savitri's love for the prince overcame her
weakness and she begged him earnestly not to
forbid her. Satyavan at last consented but told
her to bid the king and queen farewell. For he
was afraid that she might die of fatigue in the
forest. Savitri did so, and explained to them that she could not abandon Satyavan on his last day
of life. Nor could she beg him not to go into the forest. For he said that he wished to cut wood for
the sacrificial fire. The king and queen understood, and blessing her they bade her care for
Satyavan. Savitri went back to the prince and the two entered the woods. And the prince pointed
out to Savitri the streams sparkling in the sunlight and the flowering shrubs and the peacocks that
looked down upon them from the boughs of tall, leafy trees. But Savitri's heart was heavy. And
although her lips answered Satyavan, her thoughts dwelt always on his coming peril. The prince,
thinking nothing of his danger, climbed into the trees and plucked their fruit, and with his hatchet
he cut down boughs for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his head, his limbs
began to ache and sweat stood out upon his body. Slowly he walked back towards Savitri. And
Savitri, seeing his illness, ran to him and made him lie down, and taking his head in her lap bade
him sleep and rest. The prince was soon unconscious. But Savitri, who knew that the hour of

21
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



danger had come, looked anxiously about her. Soon she saw by her side a giant of monstrous
aspect. His face was black and yellow. His eyes were bloodshot. His clothes were red, and in his
hand was a mighty noose, and he wore a huge gold and jewelled crown that flashed back the rays
of the sun. Savitri guessed that he was Death, come to claim her husband. Bravely she moved the
prince's head from her lap to the ground and, rising to her full height, she faced the giant. Joining
her hands together she said with a trembling voice, "My lord, from your mighty form I know you to
be no mortal but a god. Tell me who you are and what you desire?"

"I am Yama the god of Death," answered the giant. The prince's hours were numbered from his
birth and with the noose in my hand I shall bind him and drag him away." "Lord Yama," replied
Savitri, "how is it that you have yourself come to drag away Satyavan and not, as is your custom,
sent one of your messengers?" "A prince so great and so noble as Satyavan," said Yama, "deserved
that I should come in person to take him away."

With these words he bound with his noose the helpless form of the prince and began to drag him
away towards the south. Savitri, stricken with grief, followed. A few minutes later Yama turned
round and saw that she followed, "Go back, Princess," he said, "you must return home now, and
there honour the dead prince with the last rites."

Savitri bravely faced the god and said, "The wise have said that by walking but seven paces
together one contracts friendship with another. Thus I have become your friend. Listen, therefore, I
pray you, to what I say. It is my duty to follow my husband wherever you take him, even if I go to
my death also. For true happiness lies in wedlock and neither celibacy nor widowhood equal it in
merit."

Yama was touched with Savitri's words and replied, "Princess, I, too, consider myself your friend.
Ask me, therefore for any boon you will except only the life of your husband, and I shall grant it to
you." "Lord Yama," said the princess, "my father-in-law is blind. Graciously give him back his sight.
That is the boon that I ask of you." "Princess," said Yama, "I grant you the boon. King Dyumatsena
will recover his sight."

But Savitri still followed. Shortly afterwards King Yama turned and saw her. "Princess, you are
wearied with walking. Turn back home, I beg of you. For you will gain nothing by journeying
further." "Lord Yama," answered Savitri, "I feel no fatigue while I stay with my husband, and where
he goes there also shall I go. For Satyavan was a virtuous prince, and the wise have said that but a
single day spent with the virtuous is a great gain. So I desire to spend all my life in his company."

22

Yama's heart was again touched with Savitri's words. "Princess, your words are full of wisdom and
they please me. Ask of me, therefore, a second boon. And if it is not Satyavan's life I shall grant it
to you." "Lord Yama," answered the princess, "my father-in-law King Dyumatsena through his
blindness lost his kingdom. The second boon that I ask of you is this. Grant that the king my
father-in-law may recover his kingdom." "Princess," replied King Yama, "your boon is granted and
Dyumatsena will soon be ruling happily over the kingdom of the Salyas. But now I pray you to
return homewards. For you are very weary."

But still Savitri followed King Yama. And he again asked why she did not turn back. "Lord Yama,"
said the princess, "even righteous mortals shew mercy to their enemies when they seek their
protection. You are a god and you have declared yourself my friend. It is proper for you therefore
to shew me mercy." "Indeed, I will gladly shew you mercy," answered King Yama. "But I cannot
grant you Satyavan's life. Ask me another boon and I shall grant it to you." "As you will, Lord
Yama," said Savitri. "The boon that I ask for is this. My father King Asvapati has no son. Grant that
he may have a hundred sons." "I grant you the boon," said King Yama, "and now I pray you
retrace your steps."

But Savitri still followed King Yama. Once again King Yama turned back and pressed her to go
homewards. "Lord Yama," said the princess, "you have shewn me kindness and you have shewn
mercy. But you are the Lord of Justice and it is for you now to shew me justice. I therefore beg of
you my lord Satyavan." "O Princess," said King Yama, "the life of Prince Satyavan I cannot give you.
Ask me any other boon and it shall be yours." "I thank you, Lord Yama," answered Savitri, "and the
boon that I ask is this—grant that I may bear to Prince Satyavan a hundred sons, strong, brave
and beautiful as he was."

"O Princess," said King Yama, "I grant you this boon but I cannot grant you any more. So turn back
homewards and do not weary yourself in vain by following a dead husband." "No, Lord Yama,"
said Savitri, and her wan face lit up with a smile of triumph, "the boon which you have just
granted me cannot take effect, unless you give me back Satyavan. You are an Immortal and
righteous, and you will not let your words prove false. Therefore give me back Satyavan so that I
may bear him a hundred sons."

King Yama thought deeply but he could see no escape from the snare in which the brave princess
had taken him. At last he said, "So be it, Princess. I set free your husband. You will bear him a
hundred sons, strong, brave and beautiful as he himself is. And I add to the boons which I have

given you yet another. You shall both live for four hundred years."

With these words King Yama unbound Prince Satyavan and, leaving him lying on the ground,
departed immediately to his kingdom far away in the South. But Savitri went up to her husband's
body and sitting down beside him once more placed his head on her lap. In a short time he awoke
and looked round him, not knowing where he was.

Savitri is portrayed in this tale as a person with beauty and intelligence. As she found her true
love in Satyavan, she will do everything to have him back, even going through the dangers of
facing Yama, the god of death. She used her wit and intelligence to eventually trick Yama into
returning the soul of Satyavan.

Some of the notable contemporary authors of Indian literature include Arundhati Roy and
Rabindranath Tagore. Roy was known for her famous novel, The God of Small Things (1997). It
won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. Meanwhile, Tagore was awarded with the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1913. Some of his remarkable works include Manasi (1890), Chitrangada
(Chitra,1892), and Sonar Tori (The Golden Boat, 1894).

Learn about It!

Thai Literature

Indian literature greatly influenced Thai literature. In fact, the
national epic of Thailand is called Ramakien and was referred
to as the Thai version of Ramayana. However, numerous
versions of the epic were lost after the war of Ayutthaya.

The Inao is an important classical literary work in Thailand
because it presented the history of the land, including the
people’s traditions, customs, manners, and figures
prominently in the repertoire of classical dramas. Sunthorn
Phu (1786–1855) was regarded as one of the major literary
figures in Thailand. His style of writing is sensitive toward the
life and sentiments of the common folk. This style is
brought about by his adventurous life endeavors.

In Thailand, even members of the royalty are revered as literary personalities. Historically,
King Rama V and King Rama VI had great passion for poetry, which were intensely
philosophical. This, of course, was made possible by the fact that they were introduced to
many avenues of learning.

In the early 20th century, Phya Anuman Rajadhon, a literary writer and scholar, wrote about
Thai culture, language, and folklore. His works influenced the succeeding generations of
scholars in various fields. Also, the works of Dokmaisod (the pseudonym of M.L. Boopha
Nimmanhaemindha) became popular to Thai readers. At present, her works are still read in
different grade levels in Thailand. Her best known works were: Phu Di, Nung Nai Roi, Nit, and
Chaichana Khong Luang Naruban. Another author, Malai Choopinit, was a popular name in
full-length stories. His prominent works are Thung Maharat, a novel about rural life, and Long
Phrai, a novel that is about an adventure in the forest.

Indonesian Literature

Since Indonesia is an archipelago, its literature can be described as multicultural because of
the great influences of its diverse ethnic groups. Its earliest form of literature is oral in nature
and was handed from one generation to another. When Indonesians had acquired a writing
system of their own, they wrote their literature on caves and on branches of trees and leaves.

Indonesia’s earliest recorded literary tradition dates back to the eighth century, when their
folk and ancient narratives were local versions of older Hindu texts. For two centuries,
during the Medang or Mataram Kingdom, the development in the arts, literature, and culture
because of the influence of Hindu-Buddhist traditions rapidly increased. The spread of Islam
was also helpful in the development of Indonesian literary and artistic practices as they were
exposed to Islamic ideas coming from Islamic West India, the Arab culture, and Persia. This
event paved the way for the advancement of literature and sacred texts, music and
instruments, and dance.

Wayang, with its origins dating back to the Neolithic period, is the tradition of using Javanese
shadow puppets in theater performances, and it further developed during the period of
Indianization when it was used in the portrayal of lakon, which are complex Hindu dramas.
Further refinements to this tradition were added in the 16th to 18th century upon the
country’s contact with Islamic culture.

The modern Indonesian literature was characterized by works with Western influences, which
have emerged in the twentieth century. Prose narratives differ and are influenced by Indian
literature and those of the neighboring countries. They usually focus on “beast fables,”
legends, riddles, adventure stories, and more. Texts were written in various languages, chiefly
in Javanese and Malay.

Early Javanese literature works existed between the ninth and the tenth century CE. Prose and
poetry were prevalent, they were variations of the famous Indian epics, Mahabharata and
Ramayana. Moreover, the Javanese adapted the Sanskrit court poetry and developed it as
their own. However, the onset of Dutch colonization from the 18th to the 19th century led to
the decrease in Javanese and Malay works.

In Javanese society, there is a long tradition of poets being critics of authority. During the reign
of Suharto, poets and playwrights, including W. S. Rendra and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, had

28
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



their works banned, and they were even imprisoned because their literary works expressed
their dissent against the government. Even so, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, a novelist who wrote
This Earth of Mankind won the Ramon Magsaysay Award, a prize valued as an Asian equivalent
of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The situation of the writers eased when Suharto was forced
to resign in 1998.

Learn about It!

Chinese literature dates back thousands of years, from the
dynastic court poetry to the fiction novel that blossomed
during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) to entertain the
common literate Chinese. The establishment of woodblock
printing during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and the invention
of movable type printing during the Song dynasty (960–1279)
gave rise to written Chinese literature.

Classical Poetry

The Book of Changes is one of the most important classical
texts in Chinese literature. It is a book of divination based on
eight trigrams, which existed during the Zhou dynasty. The
writers of the Warring States period attempted to explain the
world and its moral principles through the commentaries
found in additional sections of the text.

The Classic of Poetry is the earliest collection of poetry, consisting of 305 poems that included
folk and festival songs, hymns, and eulogies. The collection of documents and speeches
written by rulers and officials of Zhou period is called the Classic of History. The Classic of Rites
is a collection of texts that describes ancient rites and court ceremonies during the Zhou
dynasty. It was written during the Warring States period. The Spring and Autumn Annals is a
chronological history of the state of Lu. It contains monthly narrations of important events
during the rule of the twelve leaders of Lu. The Analects of Confucius is a book of sayings
recorded by his disciples that talks about his teachings on how to live a harmonious life and
how to deal with other people.

Classical poetry reached its peak during the Tang dynasty. The early Tang period was known
for its lushi, consisting of eight lines with five to seven characters in each line. Two
distinguished poets of the period were Li Po (Li Bai), known for the romanticism of his poems,
and Tu Fu, a Confucian moralist.

Take a look at a poem written by Li Po:

Clearing at Dawn
Li Po

The fields are chill, the sparse rain has stopped;
The colors of Spring teem on every side.
With leaping fish the blue pond is full;

With singing thrushes the green boughs droop.
The flowers of the fields have dabbled their powdered cheeks;

The mountain grasses are bent level at the waist.
By the bamboo stream the last fragment of cloud

Blown by the wind slowly scatters away.

Another poetic form that became popular was the ci form, which was first developed during
the Tang dynasty. It then flourished during the Song dynasty, as poets based ci poetry on the
tune of popular songs. The development of Chinese sanqu poetry, a freer form patterned on
dramatic arias, led to the development of vernacular Chinese literature.

Classical Prose

The Spring and Autumn periods contributed significantly to Chinese prose style. Works of
Mencius and Zhuang Zi demonstrated well-reasoned and carefully developed ideas and
showed a remarkable improvement in style. Mencius was noted for his elegant diction, while
Zhuang Zi was revered for his use of metaphorical, anecdotal, and allegorical style.

The Tang period saw the emergence of the neoclassical style of prose, which strongly

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



influenced prose writing for the next years. Han Yu (786–824) was a major essayist who
strongly advocated the return of Confucian orthodoxy. Vernacular fiction became popular
after the 14th century. The greatest 18th century vernacular novel is Dream of the Red
Chamber by Cao Xueqin.

Modern Literature

Modern Chinese literature began in the late Qing period (1895–1911), which was described as
a period of active intellectual pursuits sparked by a nationalistic climate. Translated
Western writings introduced new ideas and cultures, thereby resulting in the flowering of
prose fiction that expressed new social and cultural roles for writers. Chinese fiction became
concerned with social problems, historical upheaval, and changing values. Among the
distinguished writers of the period are:

a. Li Boyuan - He was a writer who used vernacular writing for people who did not
receive classical education. His writings are focused on social and political issues during
the late Qing dynasty as a reflection of the Chinese society of that period.

b. Liu E. - He was a writer, archaeologist, and politician who used symbolism and classical
writing illustrations in his writing. This made his writing more appealing to those who
attained classical education.

c. Zheng Pu - He was a novelist who used symbolism and classical literature illustrations
in his writing. During his time, he was also known as the only author who knew a
different language because he knew the French language.

It was also during the late Qing dynasty that the new “civilized drama” emerged, a hybrid of
Chinese operatic drama and Western-style drama. The New Culture Movement (1917–1923)
saw the vernacular language being widely used and eventually displacing the classical
language in all genres. Among those who popularized vernacular literature was Lu Xun
(1881–1936), considered the founder of modern baihua literature (literature that uses
colloquial language) in China.

With the establishment of the League of Left-Wing writers, Lu Xun and other followers
adopted the ideals of socialist realism, adhering to the principle that art must depict
contemporary events exposing the ills of nonsocialist society. The Maoist Era (1949–1976)
placed the publishing industry and the book distribution system under government control
and implemented strict censorship.

7
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Despite the measures to instill literary uniformity, a great number of novels of excellent
quality were produced. These writings became the textbooks on life of the young generation,
for they reflected the historic changes in the lives of Chinese people. The Post-Mao Era
(1976–present) published a large number of prose fiction. The writers protested against and
bemoaned the abuses but also expressed their eagerness to contribute in building a new
Chinese society. Literary outlets were revived to satisfy the increasing appetite of the people.
Literary magazines publishing translations of foreign fiction became very popular to the young
generation. Writers also became freer to write about sensitive matters that do not necessarily
conform to literary conventions. However, one of the struggles of modern writers is the
censorship imposed by the Chinese government on both journalism and literature, as
evidenced by the blocking of certain websites and the banning of some books from being sold
in China.

The literature of Japan presents a rich source of beauty and new ideas highly significant to the
West. The Western discovery of Japanese literature was aided by William George Aston’s A

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



History of Japanese Literature first published in New York in 1899.

Chinese elements are regarded as an integral part of Japanese
literature, just as the literature of Greece and Rome are an
integral part of Western literature. The literary forms of China,
as well as Chinese ideographic forms, are at the root of
Japanese literature.

The Japanese have an extensive literature spanning more than
twelve centuries, which are divided into different periods.

Archaic Period

It was marked by two events that were of prime importance to
the development of literature in Japan:

● Introduction of the art of writing (kanji) from China
Until they became acquainted with the Chinese, the Japanese had no written
characters. Chinese characters were adopted to write Japanese, creating what is known
as the man'yōgana, the earliest form of kana or syllabic writing.

● First propagation of the Buddhist religion
Buddhism gained much greater importance in Japan. It took on the highly aristocratic
and uniquely Japanese form. It was influential in developing the Japanese culture.
Literature during this period was mostly a series of songs and poems about war and
historical incidents, and series of norito or prayers to the gods of the Shinto, Japan’s
indigenous religion predating Buddhism.

Nara Period

Considered as the Golden Age of Poetry, it began in 710 AD when Nara was made the seat of
the emperor’s government and ended in 794 AD when the capital was moved to Nagaoka. It
produced two important literary works:

a. Kojiki or Records of Ancient Matters, which contain the early traditions of the Japanese
race, mythology, and legendary history; and

b. Man'yōshū or Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, the oldest extant anthology of

11
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Japanese poetry. Divided into twenty chapters or kan, it contains some 4,500 poems
written over a period of about 440 years and representing the works of several
hundred poets. This collection employs two principal poetic forms: tanka or short
poem, the most universal form of poetry in Japan, made up of 31 syllables arranged in
five lines or units; and choka or long poem, formed with 31 syllables with undefined
length and concluding with an extra seven-syllable line.

The representative prose works during this period are the following:

a. Shoku-Nihongi, a history text;
b. Izumo Fudoki, an ancient record of Izumo; and
c. Nihon Shoki or Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history.

This is a text that shows the history of Japan from its origins until 697 AD.

These texts provide historical accounts of how Japan came to be as a nation.

In the excerpt below, the text narrated the story of Izanagi and Izanami, the gods that
represent masculinity and femininity in the Shinto religion.

Nihon Shoki (excerpt)
The Story of Izanagi and Izanami (Book I)

"The Gods of Heaven addressed Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto, saying: 'There is the
country Toyo-ashi-hara-chi-i-wo-aki no midzu-ho. 'Do ye proceed and bring it into order.' They then
gave them the jewel-spear of Heaven. Hereupon the two
Gods stood on the floating bridge of Heaven, and
plunging down the spear, sought for land. Then upon
stirring the ocean with it, and bringing it up again, the
brine which dripped from the spear-point coagulated
and became an island, which was called Ono-goro-jima.
The two gods descended, dwelt in this island, and
erected there an eight-fathom palace. They also set up
the pillar of Heaven."

Then the male Deity asked the female Deity, saying:—"Is
there anything formed in thy body?" She answered and said:—"My body has a place completely

12

formed, and called the source of femineity." The male god said:—"My body again has a place
completely formed, and called the source of masculinity. I desire to unite my source of masculinity
to thy source of femineity." Having thus spoken, they prepared to go round the pillar of Heaven,
and made a promise, saying:—"Do thou, my younger sister, go round from the left, while I will go
round from the right." Having done so, they went round separately and met, when the female Deity
spoke first, and said:—"How pretty! a lovely youth!" The male Deity then answered and said:—"How
pretty! a lovely maiden!" Finally they became husband and wife.

Heian Period

This period is considered the classical age of Japanese literature. It refers to the period
when Kyoto or Heian-kyō (“City of Peace”) was the real seat of government. Its literature
reflected the pleasure-loving and effeminate but cultured and refined character of the class of
Japanese who produced it. It was largely the work of women; thus, literature during this
period was gentle and domestic.

The popular works produced during this period were the following:

a. Kokinshū (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) is an anthology of the best poems
produced during the previous 150 years; the prose work such as Kokinshū’s preface was

b. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is sometimes referred to as the first modern

The Tale of Genji (excerpt)
Murasaki Shikibu

When the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi took place. It was celebrated with a
pomp scarcely inferior to that which adorned the investiture of the first Prince. In fact, all
available treasures were exhausted on the occasion. And again the public manifested its
disapprobation. In the summer of the same year the Kiri-Tsubo-Kôyi became ill, and wished to
retire from the palace. The Emperor, however, who was accustomed to see her indisposed, strove
to induce her to remain. But her illness increased day by day; and she had drooped and pined
away until she was now but a shadow of her former self. She made scarcely any response to the

affectionate words and expressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed
upon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in the last stage of exhaustion,
and she became so much enfeebled that her mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated
with tears that she might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to devise means to
aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma to be in readiness to convey her to her own
home, but even then he went to her apartment and cried despairingly: "Did not we vow that we
would neither of us be either before or after the other even in travelling the last long journey of
life? And can you find it in your heart to leave me now?" Sadly and tenderly looking up, she thus
replied, with almost failing breath:—

"Since my departure for this dark journey,
Makes you so sad and lonely,

Fain would I stay though weak and weary,
And live for your sake only!"

"Had I but known this before—"

She appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue. Overpowered with grief,
the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany her himself, and at another moment would
have her remain to the end where she then was.

Kamakura-Muromachi Period

It was characterized by a constant state of warfare and turmoil, and the decline of
learning.

The important works of the period are the following:

a. Shin Kokinshū (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems), which is reflective of the
gloom and solitude of the period;

b. Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which tells of the defeat of the Taira by the
Minamoto clan;

c. Gempei Seisuki, which is the history of the rise and fall of the Gen and Hei, two great
noble families who fought for absolute control over Japan during the latter half of the

14

12th century, and
d. Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness) by Yoshida Kenko; it is a collection of essays on

various subjects.

The period saw the Buddhist monks as the chief maintainers of learning, the development of
renga or linked verse, and the evolution of Noh drama, which consists of a one-act dance
performed by male actors with extremely slow movements as they chant prose passages and
sing verse sections. Zeami Motokiyo developed the Noh drama to its highest form.

Edo Period

Literature during this period was more voluminous and had a far wider range of subjects. It
was produced by the merchant class and was considered as bawdy and worldly. During the
period, forms of popular drama developed, which later evolved into kabuki, a popular
Japanese theater form consisting of a colorful background, lively and emotional music,
dancing, and exaggerated acting. The period saw the perfection of the haiku, a poem of 17
syllables in three lines of five, seven, five syllables, respectively. A haiku is known to depict the
beauty of nature as seen in the eyes of the writer. Matsuo Bashō, Kobayashi Issa, and Yosa
Buson were notable haiku writers of this period.

The following is a side by side Japanese-English translation of a haiku by Matsuo Bashō. The
translation is by William George Aston.

Frog Poem
Matsuo Bashō

(translated by W.G. Aston)

Japanese English
Furu ike ya

kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto

An ancient pond!
With a sound from the water
Of the frog as it plunges in.

Take note that in the original Japanese version, the syllables follow the 5-7-5 pattern in the
respective order of lines. It also shows the emotion and imagery of nature as seen by the
writer. Interpretations may depend on the reader of a haiku.

Other important works of the period are the following: Koshoku ichidai otoko, Tōkaidōchū
Hizakurige, and Oku no Hosomichi. These Japanese works reflect philosophical meditations
toward existence. They highlight Japanese sensibilities when it comes to daily or mundane
experiences.

Meiji Era

The Meiji era saw the reopening of Japan to the West and was a period of rapid
industrialization. It bore witness to the following:

● Fukuzawa Yukichi and Nakae Chōmin wrote enlightenment literature, while
pre-modern popular books portrayed the fast-changing country;

● Haibun, a kind of composition that combines prose and haiku, flourished during this
period;

● Ichiyō Higuchi, a woman writer who wrote short stories on powerless women of this
age, was among the first important writers who emerged during this era;

● Izumi Kyōka, who wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) and The Holy
Man of Mount Koya (1900), is revered for having his own distinctive style that made use
of supernatural elements.

Modern Period

During this time, literature is characterized by the denial of the worth of traditional writings
and by themes of disaffection, loss of purpose, and coping with defeat as a result of World
War II and Japan’s defeat. Osamu Dazai’s novel, The Setting Sun, is one of the stories that
reflect the aftermath of war.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and the 1980s identified with intellectual and moral issues in
their attempt to raise social and political consciousness. These writers include the following:

● Kenzaburō Ōe wrote A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan’s second winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature;

16

● Kōbō Abe wrote fantastic novels such as Woman in the Dunes, which won the Yomiuri
Prize for literature in 1962 and was adapted into a film in 1964;

● Shizuko Todo won the 1988 Naoki Prize for Ripening Summer, a story that captures the
complex psychology of modern women;

● Haruki Murakami remains as one of the most popular and controversial of today’s
widely acclaimed Japanese authors.

In the 1980s, Japan established its prominence in the literary scene by producing manga
(comic books). Manga became popular as a material for leisure reading of children and young
adults. Part of the reason why manga was successful was its portrayal of women in the
modern world, and ultimately its representation of a traditional country, such as Japan, which
embraces the challenges of urbanity and the future.

Indian literature pertains not only to the literature of what we know as India today but also
that of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Historically, these countries were considered one until the
partition of India in 1947, which created India and Pakistan. Then, in 1971, Bangladesh
seceded from Pakistan. In the case of literature, although the countries are no longer one,
their literary tradition is unquestionably united.

Today, the constitution of India recognizes 22 official
languages. This includes Sanskrit, which is an ancient
language that was used for writing epics and religious texts.
Though Sanskrit is no longer used by the majority, it is still
considered an important part of Indian cultural heritage that
is at par with the Latin and Greek of the West. While Sanskrit
and other languages developed from Sanskrit are still active
languages in Northern India, most languages used in the
south come from Dravidian, a different language family. An
example of Dravidian language is Tamil. Because of the
contact of Indians with Persians and the rest of the Middle
East, Urdu emerged as a language in the 1500s. As India was
colonized by the British Empire, English became a vital
language. However, only a small percentage of the Indian
population use English because it is mostly accessible through formal education. The Indian
colonial experience affected how writers expressed their sentiments.

Most literary forms and works in Indian literature incorporate philosophical and religious
concepts. Often, these works are viewed as extensions of Hindu teachings. Considered to be
the oldest Hindu writings, the Vedas (meaning “knowledge” in Sanskrit) are a collection of
sacred books written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas:

● Rig Veda (“knowledge of the verses”) - a collection of 1,028 sacred hymns and is divided
into ten books called Mandalas;

● Yajur Veda (“knowledge of the sacrifice”) - a handbook for priests in the performance of
sacrificial rituals;

● Sama Veda (“knowledge of the melodies”) - a collection of chants and melodies drawn
from the Rig Veda and are to be sung during worship; and

● Atharva Veda (“knowledge of the fire priest”) - a collection of charms, spells, and hymns,
largely outside of the scope of worship and Vedic sacrifice.

India prides itself as a civilization that holds some of the world’s oldest epics: the Mahabharata
by Vyasa and Ramayana by Valmiki. Mahabharata narrates an ancient tale of war within a
family caused by a desire for power. The entire text contains 100,000 lines, hence, it is
considered as one of the longest literary masterpieces. It is actually a group of poems in
one. The epic story of the great war between the two branches of the Bharat family comprises

20
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



only about a fifth of the whole work, which runs about 100,000 sloka (lines) or double
octosyllabic couplets and is contained in eighteen books and a supplement. Meanwhile, the
Ramayana takes its story from an episode in the Mahabharata and gives it a romantic
treatment in the form of kavya or court poetry. It centers on the life and adventures of the
couple Ramachandra and Sita. The tale of Savitri is another narrative found in Mahabharata. It
is told to the exiled king of the Pandavas by way of consoling him for the plight of his
much-tried queen, Draupadi. Savitri takes her place alongside the more famous Sita (heroine
of the Ramayana) and the admirable Shakuntala (whose story is also told in the Mahabharata)
as the type of ideal Indian womanhood.

Here is an excerpt of the tale of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata:

Savitri and Satyavan (excerpt)
from the Mahabharata

"Wait my husband," she said, "let me go with
you. To-day I cannot leave you." Satyavan sought
to dissuade her. "You are weak with fasting," he
said, "and the paths are steep and rugged." But
Savitri's love for the prince overcame her
weakness and she begged him earnestly not to
forbid her. Satyavan at last consented but told
her to bid the king and queen farewell. For he
was afraid that she might die of fatigue in the
forest. Savitri did so, and explained to them that she could not abandon Satyavan on his last day
of life. Nor could she beg him not to go into the forest. For he said that he wished to cut wood for
the sacrificial fire. The king and queen understood, and blessing her they bade her care for
Satyavan. Savitri went back to the prince and the two entered the woods. And the prince pointed
out to Savitri the streams sparkling in the sunlight and the flowering shrubs and the peacocks that
looked down upon them from the boughs of tall, leafy trees. But Savitri's heart was heavy. And
although her lips answered Satyavan, her thoughts dwelt always on his coming peril. The prince,
thinking nothing of his danger, climbed into the trees and plucked their fruit, and with his hatchet
he cut down boughs for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his head, his limbs
began to ache and sweat stood out upon his body. Slowly he walked back towards Savitri. And
Savitri, seeing his illness, ran to him and made him lie down, and taking his head in her lap bade
him sleep and rest. The prince was soon unconscious. But Savitri, who knew that the hour of

21

danger had come, looked anxiously about her. Soon she saw by her side a giant of monstrous
aspect. His face was black and yellow. His eyes were bloodshot. His clothes were red, and in his
hand was a mighty noose, and he wore a huge gold and jewelled crown that flashed back the rays
of the sun. Savitri guessed that he was Death, come to claim her husband. Bravely she moved the
prince's head from her lap to the ground and, rising to her full height, she faced the giant. Joining
her hands together she said with a trembling voice, "My lord, from your mighty form I know you to
be no mortal but a god. Tell me who you are and what you desire?"

"I am Yama the god of Death," answered the giant. The prince's hours were numbered from his
birth and with the noose in my hand I shall bind him and drag him away." "Lord Yama," replied
Savitri, "how is it that you have yourself come to drag away Satyavan and not, as is your custom,
sent one of your messengers?" "A prince so great and so noble as Satyavan," said Yama, "deserved
that I should come in person to take him away."

With these words he bound with his noose the helpless form of the prince and began to drag him
away towards the south. Savitri, stricken with grief, followed. A few minutes later Yama turned
round and saw that she followed, "Go back, Princess," he said, "you must return home now, and
there honour the dead prince with the last rites."

Savitri bravely faced the god and said, "The wise have said that by walking but seven paces
together one contracts friendship with another. Thus I have become your friend. Listen, therefore, I
pray you, to what I say. It is my duty to follow my husband wherever you take him, even if I go to
my death also. For true happiness lies in wedlock and neither celibacy nor widowhood equal it in
merit."

Yama was touched with Savitri's words and replied, "Princess, I, too, consider myself your friend.
Ask me, therefore for any boon you will except only the life of your husband, and I shall grant it to
you." "Lord Yama," said the princess, "my father-in-law is blind. Graciously give him back his sight.
That is the boon that I ask of you." "Princess," said Yama, "I grant you the boon. King Dyumatsena
will recover his sight."

But Savitri still followed. Shortly afterwards King Yama turned and saw her. "Princess, you are
wearied with walking. Turn back home, I beg of you. For you will gain nothing by journeying
further." "Lord Yama," answered Savitri, "I feel no fatigue while I stay with my husband, and where
he goes there also shall I go. For Satyavan was a virtuous prince, and the wise have said that but a
single day spent with the virtuous is a great gain. So I desire to spend all my life in his company."

22

Yama's heart was again touched with Savitri's words. "Princess, your words are full of wisdom and
they please me. Ask of me, therefore, a second boon. And if it is not Satyavan's life I shall grant it
to you." "Lord Yama," answered the princess, "my father-in-law King Dyumatsena through his
blindness lost his kingdom. The second boon that I ask of you is this. Grant that the king my
father-in-law may recover his kingdom." "Princess," replied King Yama, "your boon is granted and
Dyumatsena will soon be ruling happily over the kingdom of the Salyas. But now I pray you to
return homewards. For you are very weary."

But still Savitri followed King Yama. And he again asked why she did not turn back. "Lord Yama,"
said the princess, "even righteous mortals shew mercy to their enemies when they seek their
protection. You are a god and you have declared yourself my friend. It is proper for you therefore
to shew me mercy." "Indeed, I will gladly shew you mercy," answered King Yama. "But I cannot
grant you Satyavan's life. Ask me another boon and I shall grant it to you." "As you will, Lord
Yama," said Savitri. "The boon that I ask for is this. My father King Asvapati has no son. Grant that
he may have a hundred sons." "I grant you the boon," said King Yama, "and now I pray you
retrace your steps."

But Savitri still followed King Yama. Once again King Yama turned back and pressed her to go
homewards. "Lord Yama," said the princess, "you have shewn me kindness and you have shewn
mercy. But you are the Lord of Justice and it is for you now to shew me justice. I therefore beg of
you my lord Satyavan." "O Princess," said King Yama, "the life of Prince Satyavan I cannot give you.
Ask me any other boon and it shall be yours." "I thank you, Lord Yama," answered Savitri, "and the
boon that I ask is this—grant that I may bear to Prince Satyavan a hundred sons, strong, brave
and beautiful as he was."

"O Princess," said King Yama, "I grant you this boon but I cannot grant you any more. So turn back
homewards and do not weary yourself in vain by following a dead husband." "No, Lord Yama,"
said Savitri, and her wan face lit up with a smile of triumph, "the boon which you have just
granted me cannot take effect, unless you give me back Satyavan. You are an Immortal and
righteous, and you will not let your words prove false. Therefore give me back Satyavan so that I
may bear him a hundred sons."

King Yama thought deeply but he could see no escape from the snare in which the brave princess
had taken him. At last he said, "So be it, Princess. I set free your husband. You will bear him a
hundred sons, strong, brave and beautiful as he himself is. And I add to the boons which I have

23

given you yet another. You shall both live for four hundred years."

With these words King Yama unbound Prince Satyavan and, leaving him lying on the ground,
departed immediately to his kingdom far away in the South. But Savitri went up to her husband's
body and sitting down beside him once more placed his head on her lap. In a short time he awoke
and looked round him, not knowing where he was.

Savitri is portrayed in this tale as a person with beauty and intelligence. As she found her true
love in Satyavan, she will do everything to have him back, even going through the dangers of
facing Yama, the god of death. She used her wit and intelligence to eventually trick Yama into
returning the soul of Satyavan.

Some of the notable contemporary authors of Indian literature include Arundhati Roy and
Rabindranath Tagore. Roy was known for her famous novel, The God of Small Things (1997). It
won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. Meanwhile, Tagore was awarded with the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1913. Some of his remarkable works include Manasi (1890), Chitrangada
(Chitra,1892), and Sonar Tori (The Golden Boat, 1894).

Thai Literature

Indian literature greatly influenced Thai literature. In fact, the
national epic of Thailand is called Ramakien and was referred
to as the Thai version of Ramayana. However, numerous
versions of the epic were lost after the war of Ayutthaya.

The Inao is an important classical literary work in Thailand
because it presented the history of the land, including the
people’s traditions, customs, manners, and figures
prominently in the repertoire of classical dramas. Sunthorn
Phu (1786–1855) was regarded as one of the major literary
figures in Thailand. His style of writing is sensitive toward the
life and sentiments of the common folk. This style is
brought about by his adventurous life endeavors.

In Thailand, even members of the royalty are revered as literary personalities. Historically,
King Rama V and King Rama VI had great passion for poetry, which were intensely
philosophical. This, of course, was made possible by the fact that they were introduced to
many avenues of learning.

In the early 20th century, Phya Anuman Rajadhon, a literary writer and scholar, wrote about
Thai culture, language, and folklore. His works influenced the succeeding generations of
scholars in various fields. Also, the works of Dokmaisod (the pseudonym of M.L. Boopha
Nimmanhaemindha) became popular to Thai readers. At present, her works are still read in
different grade levels in Thailand. Her best known works were: Phu Di, Nung Nai Roi, Nit, and
Chaichana Khong Luang Naruban. Another author, Malai Choopinit, was a popular name in
full-length stories. His prominent works are Thung Maharat, a novel about rural life, and Long
Phrai, a novel that is about an adventure in the forest.

Indonesian Literature

Since Indonesia is an archipelago, its literature can be described as multicultural because of
the great influences of its diverse ethnic groups. Its earliest form of literature is oral in nature
and was handed from one generation to another. When Indonesians had acquired a writing
system of their own, they wrote their literature on caves and on branches of trees and leaves.

Indonesia’s earliest recorded literary tradition dates back to the eighth century, when their
folk and ancient narratives were local versions of older Hindu texts. For two centuries,
during the Medang or Mataram Kingdom, the development in the arts, literature, and culture
because of the influence of Hindu-Buddhist traditions rapidly increased. The spread of Islam
was also helpful in the development of Indonesian literary and artistic practices as they were
exposed to Islamic ideas coming from Islamic West India, the Arab culture, and Persia. This
event paved the way for the advancement of literature and sacred texts, music and
instruments, and dance.

Wayang, with its origins dating back to the Neolithic period, is the tradition of using Javanese
shadow puppets in theater performances, and it further developed during the period of
Indianization when it was used in the portrayal of lakon, which are complex Hindu dramas.
Further refinements to this tradition were added in the 16th to 18th century upon the
country’s contact with Islamic culture.

The modern Indonesian literature was characterized by works with Western influences, which
have emerged in the twentieth century. Prose narratives differ and are influenced by Indian
literature and those of the neighboring countries. They usually focus on “beast fables,”
legends, riddles, adventure stories, and more. Texts were written in va
