Correcting a Dangling Modifier
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be describing. 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must supply the missing modified word to complete the thought of the sentence. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the context of the sentence.

4,"Example

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground.

In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying the water jug. It may leave an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. One way of correcting the sentence is to leave the modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the pronoun I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, I saw my water jug fall on the ground.”
