Indian literature pertains not only to the literature of what we know as India today but also that of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Historically, these countries were considered one until the partition of India in 1947, which created India and Pakistan. Then, in 1971, Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan. In the case of literature, although the countries are no longer one, their literary tradition is unquestionably united.
Today, the constitution of India recognizes 22 official languages. This includes Sanskrit, which is an ancient language that was used for writing epics and religious texts. Though Sanskrit is no longer used by the majority, it is still considered an important part of Indian cultural heritage that is at par with the Latin and Greek of the West. While Sanskrit and other languages developed from Sanskrit are still active languages in Northern India, most languages used in the south come from Dravidian, a different language family. As India was colonized by the British Empire, English became a vital language. However, only an acute percentage of the Indian population use English because it is mostly accessible through formal education. The Indian colonial experience affected how writers expressed their sentiments.

Most literary forms and works in Indian literature incorporate philosophical and religious concepts. Often, these works are viewed as extensions of Hindu teachings. Considered to be the oldest Hindu writings, the Vedas (meaning “knowledge” in Sanskrit) are a collection of sacred books written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas:


Rig Veda (“knowledge of the verses”) - a collection of 1,028 sacred hymns and is divided into ten books called Mandalas;

Yajur Veda (“knowledge of the sacrifice”) - a handbook for priests in the performance of sacrificial rituals;

Sama Veda (“knowledge of the melodies”) - a collection of chants and melodies drawn from the Rig Veda and are to be sung during worship; and 

Atharva Veda (“knowledge of the fire priest”) - a collection of charms, spells, and hymns, largely outside of the scope of worship and Vedic sacrifice.

India prides itself as a civilization that holds some of the world’s oldest epics: the Mahabharata by Vyasa and Ramayana by Valmiki. Mahabharata narrates an ancient tale of war within a family caused by a desire for power. The entire text contains 100,000 lines, hence, it is considered as one of the longest literary masterpieces. Meanwhile, the Ramayana takes its story from an episode in the Mahabharata and gives it a romantic treatment in the form of kavya or court poetry. 
Some of the notable contemporary authors of Indian literature include Arundhati Roy and Rabindranath Tagore. Roy was known for her famous novel, The God of Small Things (1997). It won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. Meanwhile, Tagore was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Some of his remarkable works include Manasi (1890), Chitrangada (Chitra,1892), and Sonar Tori (The Golden Boat, 1894).

Lesson 1: Chinese Literature

Home to 1.3 billion people, China remains to be a country filled
with a long and colorful history where even the oldest of rites
are still being practiced by its citizens up to this day. One of the
significant contributions of China to the world is its rich literary
heritage that dates back in the ancient times. Its literature has
extended from the East to the West and has been revered all
over the world.

Learn about It!

Chinese literature dates back thousands of years, from the
dynastic court poetry to the fiction novel that blossomed
during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) to entertain the
common literate Chinese. The establishment of woodblock
printing during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and the invention
of movable type printing during the Song dynasty (960–1279)
gave rise to written Chinese literature.

Classical Poetry

The Book of Changes is one of the most important classical
texts in Chinese literature. It is a book of divination based on
eight trigrams, which existed during the Zhou dynasty. The
writers of the Warring States period attempted to explain the
world and its moral principles through the commentaries
found in additional sections of the text.

The Classic of Poetry is the earliest collection of poetry, consisting of 305 poems that included
folk and festival songs, hymns, and eulogies. The collection of documents and speeches
written by rulers and officials of Zhou period is called the Classic of History. The Classic of Rites
is a collection of texts that describes ancient rites and court ceremonies during the Zhou
dynasty. It was written during the Warring States period. The Spring and Autumn Annals is a
chronological history of the state of Lu. It contains monthly narrations of important events
during the rule of the twelve leaders of Lu. The Analects of Confucius is a book of sayings
recorded by his disciples that talks about his teachings on how to live a harmonious life and
how to deal with other people.

Classical poetry reached its peak during the Tang dynasty. The early Tang period was known
for its lushi, consisting of eight lines with five to seven characters in each line. Two
distinguished poets of the period were Li Po (Li Bai), known for the romanticism of his poems,
and Tu Fu, a Confucian moralist.

Take a look at a poem written by Li Po:

Clearing at Dawn
Li Po

The fields are chill, the sparse rain has stopped;
The colors of Spring teem on every side.
With leaping fish the blue pond is full;

With singing thrushes the green boughs droop.
The flowers of the fields have dabbled their powdered cheeks;

The mountain grasses are bent level at the waist.
By the bamboo stream the last fragment of cloud

Blown by the wind slowly scatters away.

Another poetic form that became popular was the ci form, which was first developed during
the Tang dynasty. It then flourished during the Song dynasty, as poets based ci poetry on the
tune of popular songs. The development of Chinese sanqu poetry, a freer form patterned on
dramatic arias, led to the development of vernacular Chinese literature.

Classical Prose

The Spring and Autumn periods contributed significantly to Chinese prose style. Works of
Mencius and Zhuang Zi demonstrated well-reasoned and carefully developed ideas and
showed a remarkable improvement in style. Mencius was noted for his elegant diction, while
Zhuang Zi was revered for his use of metaphorical, anecdotal, and allegorical style.

The Tang period saw the emergence of the neoclassical style of prose, which strongly

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



influenced prose writing for the next years. Han Yu (786–824) was a major essayist who
strongly advocated the return of Confucian orthodoxy. Vernacular fiction became popular
after the 14th century. The greatest 18th century vernacular novel is Dream of the Red
Chamber by Cao Xueqin.

Modern Literature

Modern Chinese literature began in the late Qing period (1895–1911), which was described as
a period of active intellectual pursuits sparked by a nationalistic climate. Translated
Western writings introduced new ideas and cultures, thereby resulting in the flowering of
prose fiction that expressed new social and cultural roles for writers. Chinese fiction became
concerned with social problems, historical upheaval, and changing values. Among the
distinguished writers of the period are:

a. Li Boyuan - He was a writer who used vernacular writing for people who did not
receive classical education. His writings are focused on social and political issues during
the late Qing dynasty as a reflection of the Chinese society of that period.

b. Liu E. - He was a writer, archaeologist, and politician who used symbolism and classical
writing illustrations in his writing. This made his writing more appealing to those who
attained classical education.

c. Zheng Pu - He was a novelist who used symbolism and classical literature illustrations
in his writing. During his time, he was also known as the only author who knew a
different language because he knew the French language.

It was also during the late Qing dynasty that the new “civilized drama” emerged, a hybrid of
Chinese operatic drama and Western-style drama. The New Culture Movement (1917–1923)
saw the vernacular language being widely used and eventually displacing the classical
language in all genres. Among those who popularized vernacular literature was Lu Xun
(1881–1936), considered the founder of modern baihua literature (literature that uses
colloquial language) in China.

With the establishment of the League of Left-Wing writers, Lu Xun and other followers
adopted the ideals of socialist realism, adhering to the principle that art must depict
contemporary events exposing the ills of nonsocialist society. The Maoist Era (1949–1976)
placed the publishing industry and the book distribution system under government control
and implemented strict censorship.

7
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Despite the measures to instill literary uniformity, a great number of novels of excellent
quality were produced. These writings became the textbooks on life of the young generation,
for they reflected the historic changes in the lives of Chinese people. The Post-Mao Era
(1976–present) published a large number of prose fiction. The writers protested against and
bemoaned the abuses but also expressed their eagerness to contribute in building a new
Chinese society. Literary outlets were revived to satisfy the increasing appetite of the people.
Literary magazines publishing translations of foreign fiction became very popular to the young
generation. Writers also became freer to write about sensitive matters that do not necessarily
conform to literary conventions. However, one of the struggles of modern writers is the
censorship imposed by the Chinese government on both journalism and literature, as
evidenced by the blocking of certain websites and the banning of some books from being sold
in China.

Lesson 2: Japanese Literature

Japanese literature has landed a special place in the
worldwide literary scene when manga was introduced.
However, Japanese literature has its roots dating back
centuries ago. It has survived various periods and rapid
changes of time. It has come a long a way to become what
we know today.

The literature of Japan presents a rich source of beauty and new ideas highly significant to the
West. The Western discovery of Japanese literature was aided by William George Aston’s A

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



History of Japanese Literature first published in New York in 1899.

Chinese elements are regarded as an integral part of Japanese
literature, just as the literature of Greece and Rome are an
integral part of Western literature. The literary forms of China,
as well as Chinese ideographic forms, are at the root of
Japanese literature.

The Japanese have an extensive literature spanning more than
twelve centuries, which are divided into different periods.

Archaic Period

It was marked by two events that were of prime importance to
the development of literature in Japan:

● Introduction of the art of writing (kanji) from China
Until they became acquainted with the Chinese, the Japanese had no written
characters. Chinese characters were adopted to write Japanese, creating what is known
as the man'yōgana, the earliest form of kana or syllabic writing.

● First propagation of the Buddhist religion
Buddhism gained much greater importance in Japan. It took on the highly aristocratic
and uniquely Japanese form. It was influential in developing the Japanese culture.
Literature during this period was mostly a series of songs and poems about war and
historical incidents, and series of norito or prayers to the gods of the Shinto, Japan’s
indigenous religion predating Buddhism.

Nara Period

Considered as the Golden Age of Poetry, it began in 710 AD when Nara was made the seat of
the emperor’s government and ended in 794 AD when the capital was moved to Nagaoka. It
produced two important literary works:

a. Kojiki or Records of Ancient Matters, which contain the early traditions of the Japanese
race, mythology, and legendary history; and

b. Man'yōshū or Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, the oldest extant anthology of

11
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Japanese poetry. Divided into twenty chapters or kan, it contains some 4,500 poems
written over a period of about 440 years and representing the works of several
hundred poets. This collection employs two principal poetic forms: tanka or short
poem, the most universal form of poetry in Japan, made up of 31 syllables arranged in
five lines or units; and choka or long poem, formed with 31 syllables with undefined
length and concluding with an extra seven-syllable line.

The representative prose works during this period are the following:

a. Shoku-Nihongi, a history text;
b. Izumo Fudoki, an ancient record of Izumo; and
c. Nihon Shoki or Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history.

This is a text that shows the history of Japan from its origins until 697 AD.

These texts provide historical accounts of how Japan came to be as a nation.

In the excerpt below, the text narrated the story of Izanagi and Izanami, the gods that
represent masculinity and femininity in the Shinto religion.

Nihon Shoki (excerpt)
The Story of Izanagi and Izanami (Book I)

""The Gods of Heaven addressed Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto, saying: 'There is the
country Toyo-ashi-hara-chi-i-wo-aki no midzu-ho. 'Do ye proceed and bring it into order.' They then
gave them the jewel-spear of Heaven. Hereupon the two
Gods stood on the floating bridge of Heaven, and
plunging down the spear, sought for land. Then upon
stirring the ocean with it, and bringing it up again, the
brine which dripped from the spear-point coagulated
and became an island, which was called Ono-goro-jima.
The two gods descended, dwelt in this island, and
erected there an eight-fathom palace. They also set up
the pillar of Heaven.""

Then the male Deity asked the female Deity, saying:—""Is
there anything formed in thy body?"" She answered and said:—""My body has a place completely

12

formed, and called the source of femineity."" The male god said:—""My body again has a place
completely formed, and called the source of masculinity. I desire to unite my source of masculinity
to thy source of femineity."" Having thus spoken, they prepared to go round the pillar of Heaven,
and made a promise, saying:—""Do thou, my younger sister, go round from the left, while I will go
round from the right."" Having done so, they went round separately and met, when the female Deity
spoke first, and said:—""How pretty! a lovely youth!"" The male Deity then answered and said:—""How
pretty! a lovely maiden!"" Finally they became husband and wife.

Heian Period

This period is considered the classical age of Japanese literature. It refers to the period
when Kyoto or Heian-kyō (“City of Peace”) was the real seat of government. Its literature
reflected the pleasure-loving and effeminate but cultured and refined character of the class of
Japanese who produced it. It was largely the work of women; thus, literature during this
period was gentle and domestic.

The popular works produced during this period were the following:

a. Kokinshū (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) is an anthology of the best poems
produced during the previous 150 years; the prose work such as Kokinshū’s preface was
written by Ki No Tsurayuki and which was the start of criticism becoming a distinct form
of Japanese literature; and

b. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is sometimes referred to as the first modern
Japanese novel. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter of the novel.

The Tale of Genji (excerpt)
Murasaki Shikibu

When the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi took place. It was celebrated with a
pomp scarcely inferior to that which adorned the investiture of the first Prince. In fact, all
available treasures were exhausted on the occasion. And again the public manifested its
disapprobation. In the summer of the same year the Kiri-Tsubo-Kôyi became ill, and wished to
retire from the palace. The Emperor, however, who was accustomed to see her indisposed, strove
to induce her to remain. But her illness increased day by day; and she had drooped and pined
away until she was now but a shadow of her former self. She made scarcely any response to the

13
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



affectionate words and expressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed
upon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in the last stage of exhaustion,
and she became so much enfeebled that her mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated
with tears that she might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to devise means to
aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma to be in readiness to convey her to her own
home, but even then he went to her apartment and cried despairingly: ""Did not we vow that we
would neither of us be either before or after the other even in travelling the last long journey of
life? And can you find it in your heart to leave me now?"" Sadly and tenderly looking up, she thus
replied, with almost failing breath:—

""Since my departure for this dark journey,
Makes you so sad and lonely,

Fain would I stay though weak and weary,
And live for your sake only!""

""Had I but known this before—""

She appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue. Overpowered with grief,
the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany her himself, and at another moment would
have her remain to the end where she then was.

Kamakura-Muromachi Period

It was characterized by a constant state of warfare and turmoil, and the decline of
learning.

The important works of the period are the following:

a. Shin Kokinshū (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems), which is reflective of the
gloom and solitude of the period;

b. Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which tells of the defeat of the Taira by the
Minamoto clan;

c. Gempei Seisuki, which is the history of the rise and fall of the Gen and Hei, two great
noble families who fought for absolute control over Japan during the latter half of the

14
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



12th century, and
d. Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness) by Yoshida Kenko; it is a collection of essays on

various subjects.

The period saw the Buddhist monks as the chief maintainers of learning, the development of
renga or linked verse, and the evolution of Noh drama, which consists of a one-act dance
performed by male actors with extremely slow movements as they chant prose passages and
sing verse sections. Zeami Motokiyo developed the Noh drama to its highest form.

Edo Period

Literature during this period was more voluminous and had a far wider range of subjects. It
was produced by the merchant class and was considered as bawdy and worldly. During the
period, forms of popular drama developed, which later evolved into kabuki, a popular
Japanese theater form consisting of a colorful background, lively and emotional music,
dancing, and exaggerated acting. The period saw the perfection of the haiku, a poem of 17
syllables in three lines of five, seven, five syllables, respectively. A haiku is known to depict the
beauty of nature as seen in the eyes of the writer. Matsuo Bashō, Kobayashi Issa, and Yosa
Buson were notable haiku writers of this period.

The following is a side by side Japanese-English translation of a haiku by Matsuo Bashō. The
translation is by William George Aston.

Frog Poem
Matsuo Bashō

(translated by W.G. Aston)

Japanese English
Furu ike ya

kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto

An ancient pond!
With a sound from the water
Of the frog as it plunges in.

15
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Take note that in the original Japanese version, the syllables follow the 5-7-5 pattern in the
respective order of lines. It also shows the emotion and imagery of nature as seen by the
writer. Interpretations may depend on the reader of a haiku.

Other important works of the period are the following: Koshoku ichidai otoko, Tōkaidōchū
Hizakurige, and Oku no Hosomichi. These Japanese works reflect philosophical meditations
toward existence. They highlight Japanese sensibilities when it comes to daily or mundane
experiences.

Meiji Era

The Meiji era saw the reopening of Japan to the West and was a period of rapid
industrialization. It bore witness to the following:

● Fukuzawa Yukichi and Nakae Chōmin wrote enlightenment literature, while
pre-modern popular books portrayed the fast-changing country;

● Haibun, a kind of composition that combines prose and haiku, flourished during this
period;

● Ichiyō Higuchi, a woman writer who wrote short stories on powerless women of this
age, was among the first important writers who emerged during this era;

● Izumi Kyōka, who wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) and The Holy
Man of Mount Koya (1900), is revered for having his own distinctive style that made use
of supernatural elements.

Modern Period

During this time, literature is characterized by the denial of the worth of traditional writings
and by themes of disaffection, loss of purpose, and coping with defeat as a result of World
War II and Japan’s defeat. Osamu Dazai’s novel, The Setting Sun, is one of the stories that
reflect the aftermath of war.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and the 1980s identified with intellectual and moral issues in
their attempt to raise social and political consciousness. These writers include the following:

● Kenzaburō Ōe wrote A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan’s second winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature;

16
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



● Kōbō Abe wrote fantastic novels such as Woman in the Dunes, which won the Yomiuri
Prize for literature in 1962 and was adapted into a film in 1964;

● Shizuko Todo won the 1988 Naoki Prize for Ripening Summer, a story that captures the
complex psychology of modern women;

● Haruki Murakami remains as one of the most popular and controversial of today’s
widely acclaimed Japanese authors.

In the 1980s, Japan established its prominence in the literary scene by producing manga
(comic books). Manga became popular as a material for leisure reading of children and young
adults. Part of the reason why manga was successful was its portrayal of women in the
modern world, and ultimately its representation of a traditional country, such as Japan, which
embraces the challenges of urbanity and the future.

Indian literature pertains not only to the literature of what we know as India today but also
that of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Historically, these countries were considered one until the
partition of India in 1947, which created India and Pakistan. Then, in 1971, Bangladesh
seceded from Pakistan. In the case of literature, although the countries are no longer one,
their literary tradition is unquestionably united.

19

Today, the constitution of India recognizes 22 official
languages. This includes Sanskrit, which is an ancient
language that was used for writing epics and religious texts.
Though Sanskrit is no longer used by the majority, it is still
considered an important part of Indian cultural heritage that
is at par with the Latin and Greek of the West. While Sanskrit
and other languages developed from Sanskrit are still active
languages in Northern India, most languages used in the
south come from Dravidian, a different language family. An
example of Dravidian language is Tamil. Because of the
contact of Indians with Persians and the rest of the Middle
East, Urdu emerged as a language in the 1500s. As India was
colonized by the British Empire, English became a vital
language. However, only a small percentage of the Indian
population use English because it is mostly accessible through formal education. The Indian
colonial experience affected how writers expressed their sentiments.

Most literary forms and works in Indian literature incorporate philosophical and religious
concepts. Often, these works are viewed as extensions of Hindu teachings. Considered to be
the oldest Hindu writings, the Vedas (meaning “knowledge” in Sanskrit) are a collection of
sacred books written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas:

● Rig Veda (“knowledge of the verses”) - a collection of 1,028 sacred hymns and is divided
into ten books called Mandalas;

● Yajur Veda (“knowledge of the sacrifice”) - a handbook for priests in the performance of
sacrificial rituals;

● Sama Veda (“knowledge of the melodies”) - a collection of chants and melodies drawn
from the Rig Veda and are to be sung during worship; and

● Atharva Veda (“knowledge of the fire priest”) - a collection of charms, spells, and hymns,
largely outside of the scope of worship and Vedic sacrifice.

India prides itself as a civilization that holds some of the world’s oldest epics: the Mahabharata
by Vyasa and Ramayana by Valmiki. Mahabharata narrates an ancient tale of war within a
family caused by a desire for power. The entire text contains 100,000 lines, hence, it is
considered as one of the longest literary masterpieces. It is actually a group of poems in
one. The epic story of the great war between the two branches of the Bharat family comprises

20
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



only about a fifth of the whole work, which runs about 100,000 sloka (lines) or double
octosyllabic couplets and is contained in eighteen books and a supplement. Meanwhile, the
Ramayana takes its story from an episode in the Mahabharata and gives it a romantic
treatment in the form of kavya or court poetry. It centers on the life and adventures of the
couple Ramachandra and Sita. The tale of Savitri is another narrative found in Mahabharata. It
is told to the exiled king of the Pandavas by way of consoling him for the plight of his
much-tried queen, Draupadi. Savitri takes her place alongside the more famous Sita (heroine
of the Ramayana) and the admirable Shakuntala (whose story is also told in the Mahabharata)
as the type of ideal Indian womanhood.

Here is an excerpt of the tale of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata:

Savitri and Satyavan (excerpt)
from the Mahabharata

""Wait my husband,"" she said, ""let me go with
you. To-day I cannot leave you."" Satyavan sought
to dissuade her. ""You are weak with fasting,"" he
said, ""and the paths are steep and rugged."" But
Savitri's love for the prince overcame her
weakness and she begged him earnestly not to
forbid her. Satyavan at last consented but told
her to bid the king and queen farewell. For he
was afraid that she might die of fatigue in the
forest. Savitri did so, and explained to them that she could not abandon Satyavan on his last day
of life. Nor could she beg him not to go into the forest. For he said that he wished to cut wood for
the sacrificial fire. The king and queen understood, and blessing her they bade her care for
Satyavan. Savitri went back to the prince and the two entered the woods. And the prince pointed
out to Savitri the streams sparkling in the sunlight and the flowering shrubs and the peacocks that
looked down upon them from the boughs of tall, leafy trees. But Savitri's heart was heavy. And
although her lips answered Satyavan, her thoughts dwelt always on his coming peril. The prince,
thinking nothing of his danger, climbed into the trees and plucked their fruit, and with his hatchet
he cut down boughs for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his head, his limbs
began to ache and sweat stood out upon his body. Slowly he walked back towards Savitri. And
Savitri, seeing his illness, ran to him and made him lie down, and taking his head in her lap bade
him sleep and rest. The prince was soon unconscious. But Savitri, who knew that the hour of

21

danger had come, looked anxiously about her. Soon she saw by her side a giant of monstrous
aspect. His face was black and yellow. His eyes were bloodshot. His clothes were red, and in his
hand was a mighty noose, and he wore a huge gold and jewelled crown that flashed back the rays
of the sun. Savitri guessed that he was Death, come to claim her husband. Bravely she moved the
prince's head from her lap to the ground and, rising to her full height, she faced the giant. Joining
her hands together she said with a trembling voice, ""My lord, from your mighty form I know you to
be no mortal but a god. Tell me who you are and what you desire?""

""I am Yama the god of Death,"" answered the giant. The prince's hours were numbered from his
birth and with the noose in my hand I shall bind him and drag him away."" ""Lord Yama,"" replied
Savitri, ""how is it that you have yourself come to drag away Satyavan and not, as is your custom,
sent one of your messengers?"" ""A prince so great and so noble as Satyavan,"" said Yama, ""deserved
that I should come in person to take him away.""

With these words he bound with his noose the helpless form of the prince and began to drag him
away towards the south. Savitri, stricken with grief, followed. A few minutes later Yama turned
round and saw that she followed, ""Go back, Princess,"" he said, ""you must return home now, and
there honour the dead prince with the last rites.""

Savitri bravely faced the god and said, ""The wise have said that by walking but seven paces
together one contracts friendship with another. Thus I have become your friend. Listen, therefore, I
pray you, to what I say. It is my duty to follow my husband wherever you take him, even if I go to
my death also. For true happiness lies in wedlock and neither celibacy nor widowhood equal it in
merit.""

Yama was touched with Savitri's words and replied, ""Princess, I, too, consider myself your friend.
Ask me, therefore for any boon you will except only the life of your husband, and I shall grant it to
you."" ""Lord Yama,"" said the princess, ""my father-in-law is blind. Graciously give him back his sight.
That is the boon that I ask of you."" ""Princess,"" said Yama, ""I grant you the boon. King Dyumatsena
will recover his sight.""

But Savitri still followed. Shortly afterwards King Yama turned and saw her. ""Princess, you are
wearied with walking. Turn back home, I beg of you. For you will gain nothing by journeying
further."" ""Lord Yama,"" answered Savitri, ""I feel no fatigue while I stay with my husband, and where
he goes there also shall I go. For Satyavan was a virtuous prince, and the wise have said that but a
single day spent with the virtuous is a great gain. So I desire to spend all my life in his company.""

22

Yama's heart was again touched with Savitri's words. ""Princess, your words are full of wisdom and
they please me. Ask of me, therefore, a second boon. And if it is not Satyavan's life I shall grant it
to you."" ""Lord Yama,"" answered the princess, ""my father-in-law King Dyumatsena through his
blindness lost his kingdom. The second boon that I ask of you is this. Grant that the king my
father-in-law may recover his kingdom."" ""Princess,"" replied King Yama, ""your boon is granted and
Dyumatsena will soon be ruling happily over the kingdom of the Salyas. But now I pray you to
return homewards. For you are very weary.""

But still Savitri followed King Yama. And he again asked why she did not turn back. ""Lord Yama,""
said the princess, ""even righteous mortals shew mercy to their enemies when they seek their
protection. You are a god and you have declared yourself my friend. It is proper for you therefore
to shew me mercy."" ""Indeed, I will gladly shew you mercy,"" answered King Yama. ""But I cannot
grant you Satyavan's life. Ask me another boon and I shall grant it to you."" ""As you will, Lord
Yama,"" said Savitri. ""The boon that I ask for is this. My father King Asvapati has no son. Grant that
he may have a hundred sons."" ""I grant you the boon,"" said King Yama, ""and now I pray you
retrace your steps.""

But Savitri still followed King Yama. Once again King Yama turned back and pressed her to go
homewards. ""Lord Yama,"" said the princess, ""you have shewn me kindness and you have shewn
mercy. But you are the Lord of Justice and it is for you now to shew me justice. I therefore beg of
you my lord Satyavan."" ""O Princess,"" said King Yama, ""the life of Prince Satyavan I cannot give you.
Ask me any other boon and it shall be yours."" ""I thank you, Lord Yama,"" answered Savitri, ""and the
boon that I ask is this—grant that I may bear to Prince Satyavan a hundred sons, strong, brave
and beautiful as he was.""

""O Princess,"" said King Yama, ""I grant you this boon but I cannot grant you any more. So turn back
homewards and do not weary yourself in vain by following a dead husband."" ""No, Lord Yama,""
said Savitri, and her wan face lit up with a smile of triumph, ""the boon which you have just
granted me cannot take effect, unless you give me back Satyavan. You are an Immortal and
righteous, and you will not let your words prove false. Therefore give me back Satyavan so that I
may bear him a hundred sons.""

King Yama thought deeply but he could see no escape from the snare in which the brave princess
had taken him. At last he said, ""So be it, Princess. I set free your husband. You will bear him a
hundred sons, strong, brave and beautiful as he himself is. And I add to the boons which I have

23

given you yet another. You shall both live for four hundred years.""

With these words King Yama unbound Prince Satyavan and, leaving him lying on the ground,
departed immediately to his kingdom far away in the South. But Savitri went up to her husband's
body and sitting down beside him once more placed his head on her lap. In a short time he awoke
and looked round him, not knowing where he was.

Savitri is portrayed in this tale as a person with beauty and intelligence. As she found her true
love in Satyavan, she will do everything to have him back, even going through the dangers of
facing Yama, the god of death. She used her wit and intelligence to eventually trick Yama into
returning the soul of Satyavan.

Some of the notable contemporary authors of Indian literature include Arundhati Roy and
Rabindranath Tagore. Roy was known for her famous novel, The God of Small Things (1997). It
won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. Meanwhile, Tagore was awarded with the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1913. Some of his remarkable works include Manasi (1890), Chitrangada
(Chitra,1892), and Sonar Tori (The Golden Boat, 1894).

Learn about It!

Thai Literature

Indian literature greatly influenced Thai literature. In fact, the
national epic of Thailand is called Ramakien and was referred
to as the Thai version of Ramayana. However, numerous
versions of the epic were lost after the war of Ayutthaya.

The Inao is an important classical literary work in Thailand
because it presented the history of the land, including the
people’s traditions, customs, manners, and figures
prominently in the repertoire of classical dramas. Sunthorn
Phu (1786–1855) was regarded as one of the major literary
figures in Thailand. His style of writing is sensitive toward the
life and sentiments of the common folk. This style is
brought about by his adventurous life endeavors.

In Thailand, even members of the royalty are revered as literary personalities. Historically,
King Rama V and King Rama VI had great passion for poetry, which were intensely
philosophical. This, of course, was made possible by the fact that they were introduced to
many avenues of learning.

In the early 20th century, Phya Anuman Rajadhon, a literary writer and scholar, wrote about
Thai culture, language, and folklore. His works influenced the succeeding generations of
scholars in various fields. Also, the works of Dokmaisod (the pseudonym of M.L. Boopha
Nimmanhaemindha) became popular to Thai readers. At present, her works are still read in
different grade levels in Thailand. Her best known works were: Phu Di, Nung Nai Roi, Nit, and
Chaichana Khong Luang Naruban. Another author, Malai Choopinit, was a popular name in
full-length stories. His prominent works are Thung Maharat, a novel about rural life, and Long
Phrai, a novel that is about an adventure in the forest.

Indonesian Literature

Since Indonesia is an archipelago, its literature can be described as multicultural because of
the great influences of its diverse ethnic groups. Its earliest form of literature is oral in nature
and was handed from one generation to another. When Indonesians had acquired a writing
system of their own, they wrote their literature on caves and on branches of trees and leaves.

Indonesia’s earliest recorded literary tradition dates back to the eighth century, when their
folk and ancient narratives were local versions of older Hindu texts. For two centuries,
during the Medang or Mataram Kingdom, the development in the arts, literature, and culture
because of the influence of Hindu-Buddhist traditions rapidly increased. The spread of Islam
was also helpful in the development of Indonesian literary and artistic practices as they were
exposed to Islamic ideas coming from Islamic West India, the Arab culture, and Persia. This
event paved the way for the advancement of literature and sacred texts, music and
instruments, and dance.

Wayang, with its origins dating back to the Neolithic period, is the tradition of using Javanese
shadow puppets in theater performances, and it further developed during the period of
Indianization when it was used in the portrayal of lakon, which are complex Hindu dramas.
Further refinements to this tradition were added in the 16th to 18th century upon the
country’s contact with Islamic culture.

The modern Indonesian literature was characterized by works with Western influences, which
have emerged in the twentieth century. Prose narratives differ and are influenced by Indian
literature and those of the neighboring countries. They usually focus on “beast fables,”
legends, riddles, adventure stories, and more. Texts were written in various languages, chiefly
in Javanese and Malay.

Early Javanese literature works existed between the ninth and the tenth century CE. Prose and
poetry were prevalent, they were variations of the famous Indian epics, Mahabharata and
Ramayana. Moreover, the Javanese adapted the Sanskrit court poetry and developed it as
their own. However, the onset of Dutch colonization from the 18th to the 19th century led to
the decrease in Javanese and Malay works.

In Javanese society, there is a long tradition of poets being critics of authority. During the reign
of Suharto, poets and playwrights, including W. S. Rendra and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, had

28
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



their works banned, and they were even imprisoned because their literary works expressed
their dissent against the government. Even so, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, a novelist who wrote
This Earth of Mankind won the Ramon Magsaysay Award, a prize valued as an Asian equivalent
of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The situation of the writers eased when Suharto was forced
to resign in 1998.

Chinese literature dates back thousands of years, from the
dynastic court poetry to the fiction novel that blossomed
during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) to entertain the
common literate Chinese. The establishment of woodblock
printing during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and the invention
of movable type printing during the Song dynasty (960–1279)
gave rise to written Chinese literature.

Classical Poetry

The Book of Changes is one of the most important classical
texts in Chinese literature. It is a book of divination based on
eight trigrams, which existed during the Zhou dynasty. The
writers of the Warring States period attempted to explain the
world and its moral principles through the commentaries
found in additional sections of the text.

The Classic of Poetry is the earliest collection of poetry, consisting of 305 poems that included
folk and festival songs, hymns, and eulogies. The collection of documents and speeches
written by rulers and officials of Zhou period is called the Classic of History. The Classic of Rites
is a collection of texts that describes ancient rites and court ceremonies during the Zhou
dynasty. It was written during the Warring States period. The Spring and Autumn Annals is a
chronological history of the state of Lu. It contains monthly narrations of important events
during the rule of the twelve leaders of Lu. The Analects of Confucius is a book of sayings
recorded by his disciples that talks about his teachings on how to live a harmonious life and
how to deal with other people.

Classical poetry reached its peak during the Tang dynasty. The early Tang period was known
for its lushi, consisting of eight lines with five to seven characters in each line. Two
distinguished poets of the period were Li Po (Li Bai), known for the romanticism of his poems,
and Tu Fu, a Confucian moralist.

Take a look at a poem written by Li Po:

Clearing at Dawn
Li Po

The fields are chill, the sparse rain has stopped;
The colors of Spring teem on every side.
With leaping fish the blue pond is full;

With singing thrushes the green boughs droop.
The flowers of the fields have dabbled their powdered cheeks;

The mountain grasses are bent level at the waist.
By the bamboo stream the last fragment of cloud

Blown by the wind slowly scatters away.

Another poetic form that became popular was the ci form, which was first developed during
the Tang dynasty. It then flourished during the Song dynasty, as poets based ci poetry on the
tune of popular songs. The development of Chinese sanqu poetry, a freer form patterned on
dramatic arias, led to the development of vernacular Chinese literature.

Classical Prose

The Spring and Autumn periods contributed significantly to Chinese prose style. Works of
Mencius and Zhuang Zi demonstrated well-reasoned and carefully developed ideas and
showed a remarkable improvement in style. Mencius was noted for his elegant diction, while
Zhuang Zi was revered for his use of metaphorical, anecdotal, and allegorical style.

The Tang period saw the emergence of the neoclassical style of prose, which strongly

6

influenced prose writing for the next years. Han Yu (786–824) was a major essayist who
strongly advocated the return of Confucian orthodoxy. Vernacular fiction became popular
after the 14th century. The greatest 18th century vernacular novel is Dream of the Red
Chamber by Cao Xueqin.

Modern Literature

Modern Chinese literature began in the late Qing period (1895–1911), which was described as
a period of active intellectual pursuits sparked by a nationalistic climate. Translated
Western writings introduced new ideas and cultures, thereby resulting in the flowering of
prose fiction that expressed new social and cultural roles for writers. Chinese fiction became
concerned with social problems, historical upheaval, and changing values. Among the
distinguished writers of the period are:

a. Li Boyuan - He was a writer who used vernacular writing for people who did not
receive classical education. His writings are focused on social and political issues during
the late Qing dynasty as a reflection of the Chinese society of that period.

b. Liu E. - He was a writer, archaeologist, and politician who used symbolism and classical
writing illustrations in his writing. This made his writing more appealing to those who
attained classical education.

c. Zheng Pu - He was a novelist who used symbolism and classical literature illustrations
in his writing. During his time, he was also known as the only author who knew a
different language because he knew the French language.

It was also during the late Qing dynasty that the new “civilized drama” emerged, a hybrid of
Chinese operatic drama and Western-style drama. The New Culture Movement (1917–1923)
saw the vernacular language being widely used and eventually displacing the classical
language in all genres. Among those who popularized vernacular literature was Lu Xun
(1881–1936), considered the founder of modern baihua literature (literature that uses
colloquial language) in China.

With the establishment of the League of Left-Wing writers, Lu Xun and other followers
adopted the ideals of socialist realism, adhering to the principle that art must depict
contemporary events exposing the ills of nonsocialist society. The Maoist Era (1949–1976)
placed the publishing industry and the book distribution system under government control
and implemented strict censorship.

Despite the measures to instill literary uniformity, a great number of novels of excellent
quality were produced. These writings became the textbooks on life of the young generation,
for they reflected the historic changes in the lives of Chinese people. The Post-Mao Era
(1976–present) published a large number of prose fiction. The writers protested against and
bemoaned the abuses but also expressed their eagerness to contribute in building a new
Chinese society. Literary outlets were revived to satisfy the increasing appetite of the people.
Literary magazines publishing translations of foreign fiction became very popular to the young
generation. Writers also became freer to write about sensitive matters that do not necessarily
conform to literary conventions. However, one of the struggles of modern writers is the
censorship imposed by the Chinese government on both journalism and literature, as
evidenced by the blocking of certain websites and the banning of some books from being sold
in China.

Lesson 2: Japanese Literature

Japanese literature has landed a special place in the
worldwide literary scene when manga was introduced.
However, Japanese literature has its roots dating back
centuries ago. It has survived various periods and rapid
changes of time. It has come a long a way to become what
we know today.

The literature of Japan presents a rich source of beauty and new ideas highly significant to the
West. The Western discovery of Japanese literature was aided by William George Aston’s A

10

History of Japanese Literature first published in New York in 1899.

Chinese elements are regarded as an integral part of Japanese
literature, just as the literature of Greece and Rome are an
integral part of Western literature. The literary forms of China,
as well as Chinese ideographic forms, are at the root of
Japanese literature.

The Japanese have an extensive literature spanning more than
twelve centuries, which are divided into different periods.

Archaic Period

It was marked by two events that were of prime importance to
the development of literature in Japan:

● Introduction of the art of writing (kanji) from China
Until they became acquainted with the Chinese, the Japanese had no written
characters. Chinese characters were adopted to write Japanese, creating what is known
as the man'yōgana, the earliest form of kana or syllabic writing.

● First propagation of the Buddhist religion
Buddhism gained much greater importance in Japan. It took on the highly aristocratic
and uniquely Japanese form. It was influential in developing the Japanese culture.
Literature during this period was mostly a series of songs and poems about war and
historical incidents, and series of norito or prayers to the gods of the Shinto, Japan’s
indigenous religion predating Buddhism.

Nara Period

Considered as the Golden Age of Poetry, it began in 710 AD when Nara was made the seat of
the emperor’s government and ended in 794 AD when the capital was moved to Nagaoka. It
produced two important literary works:

a. Kojiki or Records of Ancient Matters, which contain the early traditions of the Japanese
race, mythology, and legendary history; and

b. Man'yōshū or Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves, the oldest extant anthology of

11
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Japanese poetry. Divided into twenty chapters or kan, it contains some 4,500 poems
written over a period of about 440 years and representing the works of several
hundred poets. This collection employs two principal poetic forms: tanka or short
poem, the most universal form of poetry in Japan, made up of 31 syllables arranged in
five lines or units; and choka or long poem, formed with 31 syllables with undefined
length and concluding with an extra seven-syllable line.

The representative prose works during this period are the following:

a. Shoku-Nihongi, a history text;
b. Izumo Fudoki, an ancient record of Izumo; and
c. Nihon Shoki or Chronicles of Japan, the second oldest book of classical Japanese history.

This is a text that shows the history of Japan from its origins until 697 AD.

These texts provide historical accounts of how Japan came to be as a nation.

In the excerpt below, the text narrated the story of Izanagi and Izanami, the gods that
represent masculinity and femininity in the Shinto religion.

Nihon Shoki (excerpt)
The Story of Izanagi and Izanami (Book I)

""The Gods of Heaven addressed Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto, saying: 'There is the
country Toyo-ashi-hara-chi-i-wo-aki no midzu-ho. 'Do ye proceed and bring it into order.' They then
gave them the jewel-spear of Heaven. Hereupon the two
Gods stood on the floating bridge of Heaven, and
plunging down the spear, sought for land. Then upon
stirring the ocean with it, and bringing it up again, the
brine which dripped from the spear-point coagulated
and became an island, which was called Ono-goro-jima.
The two gods descended, dwelt in this island, and
erected there an eight-fathom palace. They also set up
the pillar of Heaven.""

Then the male Deity asked the female Deity, saying:—""Is
there anything formed in thy body?"" She answered and said:—""My body has a place completely

12

formed, and called the source of femineity."" The male god said:—""My body again has a place
completely formed, and called the source of masculinity. I desire to unite my source of masculinity
to thy source of femineity."" Having thus spoken, they prepared to go round the pillar of Heaven,
and made a promise, saying:—""Do thou, my younger sister, go round from the left, while I will go
round from the right."" Having done so, they went round separately and met, when the female Deity
spoke first, and said:—""How pretty! a lovely youth!"" The male Deity then answered and said:—""How
pretty! a lovely maiden!"" Finally they became husband and wife.

Heian Period

This period is considered the classical age of Japanese literature. It refers to the period
when Kyoto or Heian-kyō (“City of Peace”) was the real seat of government. Its literature
reflected the pleasure-loving and effeminate but cultured and refined character of the class of
Japanese who produced it. It was largely the work of women; thus, literature during this
period was gentle and domestic.

The popular works produced during this period were the following:

a. Kokinshū (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) is an anthology of the best poems
produced during the previous 150 years; the prose work such as Kokinshū’s preface was
written by Ki No Tsurayuki and which was the start of criticism becoming a distinct form
of Japanese literature; and

b. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is sometimes referred to as the first modern
Japanese novel. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter of the novel.

The Tale of Genji (excerpt)
Murasaki Shikibu

When the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi took place. It was celebrated with a
pomp scarcely inferior to that which adorned the investiture of the first Prince. In fact, all
available treasures were exhausted on the occasion. And again the public manifested its
disapprobation. In the summer of the same year the Kiri-Tsubo-Kôyi became ill, and wished to
retire from the palace. The Emperor, however, who was accustomed to see her indisposed, strove
to induce her to remain. But her illness increased day by day; and she had drooped and pined
away until she was now but a shadow of her former self. She made scarcely any response to the

13
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



affectionate words and expressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed
upon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in the last stage of exhaustion,
and she became so much enfeebled that her mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated
with tears that she might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to devise means to
aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma to be in readiness to convey her to her own
home, but even then he went to her apartment and cried despairingly: ""Did not we vow that we
would neither of us be either before or after the other even in travelling the last long journey of
life? And can you find it in your heart to leave me now?"" Sadly and tenderly looking up, she thus
replied, with almost failing breath:—

""Since my departure for this dark journey,
Makes you so sad and lonely,

Fain would I stay though weak and weary,
And live for your sake only!""

""Had I but known this before—""

She appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue. Overpowered with grief,
the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany her himself, and at another moment would
have her remain to the end where she then was.

Kamakura-Muromachi Period

It was characterized by a constant state of warfare and turmoil, and the decline of
learning.

The important works of the period are the following:

a. Shin Kokinshū (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems), which is reflective of the
gloom and solitude of the period;

b. Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which tells of the defeat of the Taira by the
Minamoto clan;

c. Gempei Seisuki, which is the history of the rise and fall of the Gen and Hei, two great
noble families who fought for absolute control over Japan during the latter half of the

14
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



12th century, and
d. Tsurezuregusa (Essays in Idleness) by Yoshida Kenko; it is a collection of essays on

various subjects.

The period saw the Buddhist monks as the chief maintainers of learning, the development of
renga or linked verse, and the evolution of Noh drama, which consists of a one-act dance
performed by male actors with extremely slow movements as they chant prose passages and
sing verse sections. Zeami Motokiyo developed the Noh drama to its highest form.

Edo Period

Literature during this period was more voluminous and had a far wider range of subjects. It
was produced by the merchant class and was considered as bawdy and worldly. During the
period, forms of popular drama developed, which later evolved into kabuki, a popular
Japanese theater form consisting of a colorful background, lively and emotional music,
dancing, and exaggerated acting. The period saw the perfection of the haiku, a poem of 17
syllables in three lines of five, seven, five syllables, respectively. A haiku is known to depict the
beauty of nature as seen in the eyes of the writer. Matsuo Bashō, Kobayashi Issa, and Yosa
Buson were notable haiku writers of this period.

The following is a side by side Japanese-English translation of a haiku by Matsuo Bashō. The
translation is by William George Aston.

Frog Poem
Matsuo Bashō

(translated by W.G. Aston)

Japanese English
Furu ike ya

kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto

An ancient pond!
With a sound from the water
Of the frog as it plunges in.

Take note that in the original Japanese version, the syllables follow the 5-7-5 pattern in the
respective order of lines. It also shows the emotion and imagery of nature as seen by the
writer. Interpretations may depend on the reader of a haiku.

Other important works of the period are the following: Koshoku ichidai otoko, Tōkaidōchū
Hizakurige, and Oku no Hosomichi. These Japanese works reflect philosophical meditations
toward existence. They highlight Japanese sensibilities when it comes to daily or mundane
experiences.

Meiji Era

The Meiji era saw the reopening of Japan to the West and was a period of rapid
industrialization. It bore witness to the following:

● Fukuzawa Yukichi and Nakae Chōmin wrote enlightenment literature, while
pre-modern popular books portrayed the fast-changing country;

● Haibun, a kind of composition that combines prose and haiku, flourished during this
period;

● Ichiyō Higuchi, a woman writer who wrote short stories on powerless women of this
age, was among the first important writers who emerged during this era;

● Izumi Kyōka, who wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) and The Holy
Man of Mount Koya (1900), is revered for having his own distinctive style that made use
of supernatural elements.

Modern Period

During this time, literature is characterized by the denial of the worth of traditional writings
and by themes of disaffection, loss of purpose, and coping with defeat as a result of World
War II and Japan’s defeat. Osamu Dazai’s novel, The Setting Sun, is one of the stories that
reflect the aftermath of war.

Prominent writers of the 1970s and the 1980s identified with intellectual and moral issues in
their attempt to raise social and political consciousness. These writers include the following:

● Kenzaburō Ōe wrote A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan’s second winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature;

16
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



● Kōbō Abe wrote fantastic novels such as Woman in the Dunes, which won the Yomiuri
Prize for literature in 1962 and was adapted into a film in 1964;

● Shizuko Todo won the 1988 Naoki Prize for Ripening Summer, a story that captures the
complex psychology of modern women;

● Haruki Murakami remains as one of the most popular and controversial of today’s
widely acclaimed Japanese authors.

In the 1980s, Japan established its prominence in the literary scene by producing manga
(comic books). Manga became popular as a material for leisure reading of children and young
adults. Part of the reason why manga was successful was its portrayal of women in the
modern world, and ultimately its representation of a traditional country, such as Japan, which
embraces the challenges of urbanity and the future.

Indian literature pertains not only to the literature of what we know as India today but also
that of Pakistan and Bangladesh. Historically, these countries were considered one until the
partition of India in 1947, which created India and Pakistan. Then, in 1971, Bangladesh
seceded from Pakistan. In the case of literature, although the countries are no longer one,
their literary tradition is unquestionably united.

19

Today, the constitution of India recognizes 22 official
languages. This includes Sanskrit, which is an ancient
language that was used for writing epics and religious texts.
Though Sanskrit is no longer used by the majority, it is still
considered an important part of Indian cultural heritage that
is at par with the Latin and Greek of the West. While Sanskrit
and other languages developed from Sanskrit are still active
languages in Northern India, most languages used in the
south come from Dravidian, a different language family. An
example of Dravidian language is Tamil. Because of the
contact of Indians with Persians and the rest of the Middle
East, Urdu emerged as a language in the 1500s. As India was
colonized by the British Empire, English became a vital
language. However, only a small percentage of the Indian
population use English because it is mostly accessible through formal education. The Indian
colonial experience affected how writers expressed their sentiments.

Most literary forms and works in Indian literature incorporate philosophical and religious
concepts. Often, these works are viewed as extensions of Hindu teachings. Considered to be
the oldest Hindu writings, the Vedas (meaning “knowledge” in Sanskrit) are a collection of
sacred books written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas:

● Rig Veda (“knowledge of the verses”) - a collection of 1,028 sacred hymns and is divided
into ten books called Mandalas;

● Yajur Veda (“knowledge of the sacrifice”) - a handbook for priests in the performance of
sacrificial rituals;

● Sama Veda (“knowledge of the melodies”) - a collection of chants and melodies drawn
from the Rig Veda and are to be sung during worship; and

● Atharva Veda (“knowledge of the fire priest”) - a collection of charms, spells, and hymns,
largely outside of the scope of worship and Vedic sacrifice.

India prides itself as a civilization that holds some of the world’s oldest epics: the Mahabharata
by Vyasa and Ramayana by Valmiki. Mahabharata narrates an ancient tale of war within a
family caused by a desire for power. The entire text contains 100,000 lines, hence, it is
considered as one of the longest literary masterpieces. It is actually a group of poems in
one. The epic story of the great war between the two branches of the Bharat family comprises

20
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



only about a fifth of the whole work, which runs about 100,000 sloka (lines) or double
octosyllabic couplets and is contained in eighteen books and a supplement. Meanwhile, the
Ramayana takes its story from an episode in the Mahabharata and gives it a romantic
treatment in the form of kavya or court poetry. It centers on the life and adventures of the
couple Ramachandra and Sita. The tale of Savitri is another narrative found in Mahabharata. It
is told to the exiled king of the Pandavas by way of consoling him for the plight of his
much-tried queen, Draupadi. Savitri takes her place alongside the more famous Sita (heroine
of the Ramayana) and the admirable Shakuntala (whose story is also told in the Mahabharata)
as the type of ideal Indian womanhood.

Here is an excerpt of the tale of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata:

Savitri and Satyavan (excerpt)
from the Mahabharata

""Wait my husband,"" she said, ""let me go with
you. To-day I cannot leave you."" Satyavan sought
to dissuade her. ""You are weak with fasting,"" he
said, ""and the paths are steep and rugged."" But
Savitri's love for the prince overcame her
weakness and she begged him earnestly not to
forbid her. Satyavan at last consented but told
her to bid the king and queen farewell. For he
was afraid that she might die of fatigue in the
forest. Savitri did so, and explained to them that she could not abandon Satyavan on his last day
of life. Nor could she beg him not to go into the forest. For he said that he wished to cut wood for
the sacrificial fire. The king and queen understood, and blessing her they bade her care for
Satyavan. Savitri went back to the prince and the two entered the woods. And the prince pointed
out to Savitri the streams sparkling in the sunlight and the flowering shrubs and the peacocks that
looked down upon them from the boughs of tall, leafy trees. But Savitri's heart was heavy. And
although her lips answered Satyavan, her thoughts dwelt always on his coming peril. The prince,
thinking nothing of his danger, climbed into the trees and plucked their fruit, and with his hatchet
he cut down boughs for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in his head, his limbs
began to ache and sweat stood out upon his body. Slowly he walked back towards Savitri. And
Savitri, seeing his illness, ran to him and made him lie down, and taking his head in her lap bade
him sleep and rest. The prince was soon unconscious. But Savitri, who knew that the hour of

21
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



danger had come, looked anxiously about her. Soon she saw by her side a giant of monstrous
aspect. His face was black and yellow. His eyes were bloodshot. His clothes were red, and in his
hand was a mighty noose, and he wore a huge gold and jewelled crown that flashed back the rays
of the sun. Savitri guessed that he was Death, come to claim her husband. Bravely she moved the
prince's head from her lap to the ground and, rising to her full height, she faced the giant. Joining
her hands together she said with a trembling voice, ""My lord, from your mighty form I know you to
be no mortal but a god. Tell me who you are and what you desire?""

""I am Yama the god of Death,"" answered the giant. The prince's hours were numbered from his
birth and with the noose in my hand I shall bind him and drag him away."" ""Lord Yama,"" replied
Savitri, ""how is it that you have yourself come to drag away Satyavan and not, as is your custom,
sent one of your messengers?"" ""A prince so great and so noble as Satyavan,"" said Yama, ""deserved
that I should come in person to take him away.""

With these words he bound with his noose the helpless form of the prince and began to drag him
away towards the south. Savitri, stricken with grief, followed. A few minutes later Yama turned
round and saw that she followed, ""Go back, Princess,"" he said, ""you must return home now, and
there honour the dead prince with the last rites.""

Savitri bravely faced the god and said, ""The wise have said that by walking but seven paces
together one contracts friendship with another. Thus I have become your friend. Listen, therefore, I
pray you, to what I say. It is my duty to follow my husband wherever you take him, even if I go to
my death also. For true happiness lies in wedlock and neither celibacy nor widowhood equal it in
merit.""

Yama was touched with Savitri's words and replied, ""Princess, I, too, consider myself your friend.
Ask me, therefore for any boon you will except only the life of your husband, and I shall grant it to
you."" ""Lord Yama,"" said the princess, ""my father-in-law is blind. Graciously give him back his sight.
That is the boon that I ask of you."" ""Princess,"" said Yama, ""I grant you the boon. King Dyumatsena
will recover his sight.""

But Savitri still followed. Shortly afterwards King Yama turned and saw her. ""Princess, you are
wearied with walking. Turn back home, I beg of you. For you will gain nothing by journeying
further."" ""Lord Yama,"" answered Savitri, ""I feel no fatigue while I stay with my husband, and where
he goes there also shall I go. For Satyavan was a virtuous prince, and the wise have said that but a
single day spent with the virtuous is a great gain. So I desire to spend all my life in his company.""

22
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Yama's heart was again touched with Savitri's words. ""Princess, your words are full of wisdom and
they please me. Ask of me, therefore, a second boon. And if it is not Satyavan's life I shall grant it
to you."" ""Lord Yama,"" answered the princess, ""my father-in-law King Dyumatsena through his
blindness lost his kingdom. The second boon that I ask of you is this. Grant that the king my
father-in-law may recover his kingdom."" ""Princess,"" replied King Yama, ""your boon is granted and
Dyumatsena will soon be ruling happily over the kingdom of the Salyas. But now I pray you to
return homewards. For you are very weary.""

But still Savitri followed King Yama. And he again asked why she did not turn back. ""Lord Yama,""
said the princess, ""even righteous mortals shew mercy to their enemies when they seek their
protection. You are a god and you have declared yourself my friend. It is proper for you therefore
to shew me mercy."" ""Indeed, I will gladly shew you mercy,"" answered King Yama. ""But I cannot
grant you Satyavan's life. Ask me another boon and I shall grant it to you."" ""As you will, Lord
Yama,"" said Savitri. ""The boon that I ask for is this. My father King Asvapati has no son. Grant that
he may have a hundred sons."" ""I grant you the boon,"" said King Yama, ""and now I pray you
retrace your steps.""

But Savitri still followed King Yama. Once again King Yama turned back and pressed her to go
homewards. ""Lord Yama,"" said the princess, ""you have shewn me kindness and you have shewn
mercy. But you are the Lord of Justice and it is for you now to shew me justice. I therefore beg of
you my lord Satyavan."" ""O Princess,"" said King Yama, ""the life of Prince Satyavan I cannot give you.
Ask me any other boon and it shall be yours."" ""I thank you, Lord Yama,"" answered Savitri, ""and the
boon that I ask is this—grant that I may bear to Prince Satyavan a hundred sons, strong, brave
and beautiful as he was.""

""O Princess,"" said King Yama, ""I grant you this boon but I cannot grant you any more. So turn back
homewards and do not weary yourself in vain by following a dead husband."" ""No, Lord Yama,""
said Savitri, and her wan face lit up with a smile of triumph, ""the boon which you have just
granted me cannot take effect, unless you give me back Satyavan. You are an Immortal and
righteous, and you will not let your words prove false. Therefore give me back Satyavan so that I
may bear him a hundred sons.""

King Yama thought deeply but he could see no escape from the snare in which the brave princess
had taken him. At last he said, ""So be it, Princess. I set free your husband. You will bear him a
hundred sons, strong, brave and beautiful as he himself is. And I add to the boons which I have

23
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



given you yet another. You shall both live for four hundred years.""

With these words King Yama unbound Prince Satyavan and, leaving him lying on the ground,
departed immediately to his kingdom far away in the South. But Savitri went up to her husband's
body and sitting down beside him once more placed his head on her lap. In a short time he awoke
and looked round him, not knowing where he was.

Savitri is portrayed in this tale as a person with beauty and intelligence. As she found her true
love in Satyavan, she will do everything to have him back, even going through the dangers of
facing Yama, the god of death. She used her wit and intelligence to eventually trick Yama into
returning the soul of Satyavan.

Some of the notable contemporary authors of Indian literature include Arundhati Roy and
Rabindranath Tagore. Roy was known for her famous novel, The God of Small Things (1997). It
won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. Meanwhile, Tagore was awarded with the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1913. Some of his remarkable works include Manasi (1890), Chitrangada
(Chitra,1892), and Sonar Tori (The Golden Boat, 1894).

Thai Literature

Indian literature greatly influenced Thai literature. In fact, the
national epic of Thailand is called Ramakien and was referred
to as the Thai version of Ramayana. However, numerous
versions of the epic were lost after the war of Ayutthaya.

The Inao is an important classical literary work in Thailand
because it presented the history of the land, including the
people’s traditions, customs, manners, and figures
prominently in the repertoire of classical dramas. Sunthorn
Phu (1786–1855) was regarded as one of the major literary
figures in Thailand. His style of writing is sensitive toward the
life and sentiments of the common folk. This style is
brought about by his adventurous life endeavors.

In Thailand, even members of the royalty are revered as literary personalities. Historically,
King Rama V and King Rama VI had great passion for poetry, which were intensely
philosophical. This, of course, was made possible by the fact that they were introduced to
many avenues of learning.

In the early 20th century, Phya Anuman Rajadhon, a literary writer and scholar, wrote about
Thai culture, language, and folklore. His works influenced the succeeding generations of
scholars in various fields. Also, the works of Dokmaisod (the pseudonym of M.L. Boopha
Nimmanhaemindha) became popular to Thai readers. At present, her works are still read in
different grade levels in Thailand. Her best known works were: Phu Di, Nung Nai Roi, Nit, and
Chaichana Khong Luang Naruban. Another author, Malai Choopinit, was a popular name in
full-length stories. His prominent works are Thung Maharat, a novel about rural life, and Long
Phrai, a novel that is about an adventure in the forest.

Indonesian Literature

Since Indonesia is an archipelago, its literature can be described as multicultural because of
the great influences of its diverse ethnic groups. Its earliest form of literature is oral in nature
and was handed from one generation to another. When Indonesians had acquired a writing
system of their own, they wrote their literature on caves and on branches of trees and leaves.

Indonesia’s earliest recorded literary tradition dates back to the eighth century, when their
folk and ancient narratives were local versions of older Hindu texts. For two centuries,
during the Medang or Mataram Kingdom, the development in the arts, literature, and culture
because of the influence of Hindu-Buddhist traditions rapidly increased. The spread of Islam
was also helpful in the development of Indonesian literary and artistic practices as they were
exposed to Islamic ideas coming from Islamic West India, the Arab culture, and Persia. This
event paved the way for the advancement of literature and sacred texts, music and
instruments, and dance.

Wayang, with its origins dating back to the Neolithic period, is the tradition of using Javanese
shadow puppets in theater performances, and it further developed during the period of
Indianization when it was used in the portrayal of lakon, which are complex Hindu dramas.
Further refinements to this tradition were added in the 16th to 18th century upon the
country’s contact with Islamic culture.

The modern Indonesian literature was characterized by works with Western influences, which
have emerged in the twentieth century. Prose narratives differ and are influenced by Indian
literature and those of the neighboring countries. They usually focus on “beast fables,”
legends, riddles, adventure stories, and more. Texts were written in various languages, chiefly
in Javanese and Malay.

Early Javanese literature works existed between the ninth and the tenth century CE. Prose and
poetry were prevalent, they were variations of the famous Indian epics, Mahabharata and
Ramayana. Moreover, the Javanese adapted the Sanskrit court poetry and developed it as
their own. However, the onset of Dutch colonization from the 18th to the 19th century led to
the decrease in Javanese and Malay works.

In Javanese society, there is a long tradition of poets being critics of authority. During the reign
of Suharto, poets and playwrights, including W. S. Rendra and Pramoedya Ananta Toer, had

28
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



their works banned, and they were even imprisoned because their literary works expressed
their dissent against the government. Even so, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, a novelist who wrote
This Earth of Mankind won the Ramon Magsaysay Award, a prize valued as an Asian equivalent
of the Nobel Prize for Literature. The situation of the writers eased when Suharto was forced
to resign in 1998.

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost 12 million square miles. 
It houses a variety of ethnic groups, and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes Africa a multicultural continent.
One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was established more than 5,000 years ago. 
As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god and other lesser gods and deities.
With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Oral Literature
Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. 
In Western Africa, the griot is a learned storyteller, poet, performer, and historian. Griots have been handing down their oral culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany their stories with music. It takes much effort and training and a long time (several years) for them to familiarize themselves with the numerous traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.
Features of Traditional African Storytelling
Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:
a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African societies take part in storytelling. 
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” 
c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. 
d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more— as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6

suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

In Africa, prose is often used to
narrate social memories, rules, and history.
African prose narratives often center on
people, animals, and histories.
Only Africans contributed to the enrichment of
African prose.
Majority of African narratives are written.

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry
(from a heroic poem dedicated to the Zulu chief Shaka)

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
Others disappearing into the heavens!

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

The T-Chart

With a partner, go to the library and read about modern African literature (e.g., themes and
characteristics). You have exactly 25 minutes to conduct a short research and take down
notes. Do not forget to cite your source(s). Write your notes on the left-hand column of the
T-chart below. Read your notes again and sum them up in the right-hand column. Present
your work in front of the class.

Notes Summary

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.

African Prose Writing
In Africa, prose is often used to narrate social memories, rules, and history.
African prose narratives often center on people, animals, histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker (e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose
Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as follows:


Egypt – The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient system of writing.

Old Ghana – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the trade of salt and gold.

Old Mali – It overtook Old Ghana for supremacy.

Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.

Timbuktu –  It served as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books. This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both literature and civilization.

Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions
Majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:


Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and invites the audience to share judgment. 

Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty statements.

Literary Devices
Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism, personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African prose include: 


Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.

Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.

Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors
Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose: 


Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the various laws imposed by the British on land management.

Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

UNIT 18
African Literature
Africa is a continent often depicted as exotic, filled with tribes,
savannahs, jungles, and safaris. Yet behind this concept is a
broader sense of cultural heritage, history, and literary tradition,
which spans from the ancient to the contemporary. This unit
discusses the nature of African literature and gives information
regarding the various literary developments across genres (prose
and poetry).

Unit Objectives
In this unit, you should be able to:

● describe African literature;
● identify key features of African prose and African poetry; and
● explain the themes and characteristics of African literature.

Lesson 1: Introduction to African Literature

Studying African literature offers us the opportunity to listen to
the voices of African people. African literature is about their
experiences, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and values. This
lesson will help you understand the nature of African literature
and know its distinguishing features.

Warm-up!

Key Words

Form a group of four. Read the words/phrases below. First, provide a definition of the
underlined words using your own words. Then, create a one-paragraph essay about what the
group thinks African literature is all about using the words/phrases. Be ready to present your
group work in class.

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Check Your Understanding

1. What makes Africa a multicultural continent?
2. How would you describe traditional African music?
3. What is a  griot?
4. What are the features of traditional African storytelling?
5. In your own words, explain this sentence: “African literature is oral in nature.”

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

14

postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

15
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry
(from a heroic poem dedicated to the Zulu chief Shaka)

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
Others disappearing into the heavens!

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

The T-Chart

With a partner, go to the library and read about modern African literature (e.g., themes and
characteristics). You have exactly 25 minutes to conduct a short research and take down
notes. Do not forget to cite your source(s). Write your notes on the left-hand column of the
T-chart below. Read your notes again and sum them up in the right-hand column. Present
your work in front of the class.

Notes Summary

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.

1. What gave rise to African modernity?
2. According to Ali A. Mazrui, what are the seven major themes used in African literature

produced after the colonization?

GRADE 11/12 | 21st Century Literature from the Philippines and the World

UNIT 18
African Literature
Africa is a continent often depicted as exotic, filled with tribes,
savannahs, jungles, and safaris. Yet behind this concept is a
broader sense of cultural heritage, history, and literary tradition,
which spans from the ancient to the contemporary. This unit
discusses the nature of African literature and gives information
regarding the various literary developments across genres (prose
and poetry).

Unit Objectives
In this unit, you should be able to:

● describe African literature;
● identify key features of African prose and African poetry; and
● explain the themes and characteristics of African literature.

Lesson 1: Introduction to African Literature

Studying African literature offers us the opportunity to listen to
the voices of African people. African literature is about their
experiences, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and values. This
lesson will help you understand the nature of African literature
and know its distinguishing features.

Warm-up!

Key Words

Form a group of four. Read the words/phrases below. First, provide a definition of the
underlined words using your own words. Then, create a one-paragraph essay about what the
group thinks African literature is all about using the words/phrases. Be ready to present your
group work in class.

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

5

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Check Your Understanding

1. What makes Africa a multicultural continent?
2. How would you describe traditional African music?
3. What is a  griot?
4. What are the features of traditional African storytelling?
5. In your own words, explain this sentence: “African literature is oral in nature.”

Lesson 2: African Prose

In the previous lesson, you were introduced to African literature
and its features. Now, we are going to delve deeper into African
literature by discussing one of its literary forms—prose. This
lesson will help you identify the key features of African prose.

Warm-up!

True/False

Form a group of three. Read and analyze the statements below about African prose. Identify
which statements are true and which ones are not. Be ready to share and justify your
answers.

Statements True or Not True
In Africa, prose is often used to
narrate social memories, rules, and history.
African prose narratives often center on
people, animals, and histories.
Only Africans contributed to the enrichment of
African prose.
Majority of African narratives are written.
The Egyptians influenced African prose by
writing myths that honored their
gods.

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

14

postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

15
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry
(from a heroic poem dedicated to the Zulu chief Shaka)

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
Others disappearing into the heavens!
Son of Menzi!
Viper of Ndaba!

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

The T-Chart

With a partner, go to the library and read about modern African literature (e.g., themes and
characteristics). You have exactly 25 minutes to conduct a short research and take down
notes. Do not forget to cite your source(s). Write your notes on the left-hand column of the
T-chart below. Read your notes again and sum them up in the right-hand column. Present
your work in front of the class.

Notes Summary

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.

GRADE 11/12 | 21st Century Literature from the Philippines and the World

UNIT 18
African Literature
Africa is a continent often depicted as exotic, filled with tribes,
savannahs, jungles, and safaris. Yet behind this concept is a
broader sense of cultural heritage, history, and literary tradition,
which spans from the ancient to the contemporary. This unit
discusses the nature of African literature and gives information
regarding the various literary developments across genres (prose
and poetry).

Unit Objectives
In this unit, you should be able to:

● describe African literature;
● identify key features of African prose and African poetry; and
● explain the themes and characteristics of African literature.

Lesson 1: Introduction to African Literature

Studying African literature offers us the opportunity to listen to
the voices of African people. African literature is about their
experiences, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and values. This
lesson will help you understand the nature of African literature
and know its distinguishing features.

Warm-up!

Key Words

Form a group of four. Read the words/phrases below. First, provide a definition of the
underlined words using your own words. Then, create a one-paragraph essay about what the
group thinks African literature is all about using the words/phrases. Be ready to present your
group work in class.

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Check Your Understanding

1. What makes Africa a multicultural continent?
2. How would you describe traditional African music?
3. What is a  griot?
4. What are the features of traditional African storytelling?
5. In your own words, explain this sentence: “African literature is oral in nature.”

Lesson 2: African Prose

In the previous lesson, you were introduced to African literature
and its features. Now, we are going to delve deeper into African
literature by discussing one of its literary forms—prose. This
lesson will help you identify the key features of African prose.

Warm-up!

True/False

Form a group of three. Read and analyze the statements below about African prose. Identify
which statements are true and which ones are not. Be ready to share and justify your
answers.

Statements True or Not True
In Africa, prose is often used to
narrate social memories, rules, and history.
African prose narratives often center on
people, animals, and histories.
Only Africans contributed to the enrichment of
African prose.
Majority of African narratives are written.
The Egyptians influenced African prose by
writing myths that honored their
gods.

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

15

Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry
(from a heroic poem dedicated to the Zulu chief Shaka)

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
Others disappearing into the heavens!
Son of Menzi!
Viper of Ndaba!
Erect, ready to strike,
It strikes the shields of men!
Father of the cock!
Why did it disappear over the mountains?

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.
