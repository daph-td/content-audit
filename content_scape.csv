Correcting a Dangling Modifier
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be describing. 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must supply the missing modified word to complete the thought of the sentence. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the context of the sentence.

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground.

In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying the water jug. It may leave an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. One way of correcting the sentence is to leave the modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the pronoun I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, I saw my water jug fall on the ground.”

UNIT 21    
Cohesion in Writing 
In meditation, we try to connect ourselves to               
our innermost thoughts and the calming           
presence of our surroundings. Writing is the             
same. It needs the same balance and harmony               
among its sentences and paragraphs to           
connect the ideas of the writer and to convey                 
them to his or her audience. Cohesion in               
writing requires the smooth flow of words,             
phrases, and sentences in order for the             
readers to understand the ideas the writer wants to convey. In this unit, we will discuss                               
important concepts related to cohesion. 
 
 

 

Unit Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
● use appropriate modifiers;  
● use parallel structures; and 
● compose an informative essay.

Lesson 1: Misplaced Modifiers 
   

A ​modifier is a word or group of words that                   
describes some other words in the sentence. Take               
a look at this sentence: “The man found a golden                   
ticket.” In this example, the word ​golden describes               
the noun ​ticket​. Modifiers are sometimes           
misplaced in a sentence, and this may cause               
confusion. This lesson will help you learn how to spot misplaced modifiers and                         
correct them. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Think-Pair-Share 
 
With a partner, examine the sentence below. What can you and your partner say about the                               
sentence? Are the modifiers appropriately used? Revise the sentence to make it clear and                           
logical. Share your sentence in class. 
 

 

 
The sales agent sold the picture to the petite lady in the wooden frame.

Learn About It!  
 

 
There are instances in which sentences have modifiers that are                   
wrongly placed. This may cause problems in identifying what the                   
modifier describes. When a modifier is not correctly placed, it is                     
called a misplaced modifier. ​Misplaced modifiers happen when               
the modifier is not placed right next to the word it modifies.                       
Because of this, a sentence will sound awkward, ridiculous, and                   
illogical. 
 
Here is an example. 

 

The ​leather​ man’s sweater is missing. 

 
In this example, ​leather describes the word ​man​. The problem is                     
that there is no such thing as a man made of leather. Therefore,                         
the word ​leather is a misplaced modifier. To correct this sentence,                     
leather should be moved to a more sensible place such as before                       
the word ​sweater​, which will make the sentence more logical. The                     
correct sentence should be “The man’s leather sweater is                 
missing.”  
 

Here is another example. 
 

The ​crumpled​ student’s uniform was ironed this morning. 

 
The sentence in this example is quite confusing because it means that the student is                             
described as crumpled. To correct this sentence, the word ​crumpled must be placed beside                           
the word ​uniform​. Hence, the sentence will become “The student’s crumpled uniform was                         
ironed this morning.”

Here is another example. 
 

The ​torn​ child’s book lay on the table. 

 
In this example, can you identify the misplaced modifier? What is the correct placement of the                               
modifier? What is the correct sentence? 
 
 
Phrase and Clause Modifiers 
 
Phrase and clause modifiers may also be misplaced. Look at the examples below: 
 

Loaded with sauce and meatballs​, Lucy ate spaghetti. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that Lucy is covered in sauce and meatballs as she ate                                 
spaghetti. This is an illogical sentence and will confuse the readers. To correct this sentence,                             
move the phrase “loaded with sauce and meatballs” next to ​spaghetti​, which is the word it                               
should modify. The sentence will now become “Lucy ate spaghetti loaded with sauce and                           
meatballs.” 
 

Sheryl saw a kitten ​on the way to the airport​. 

 
In this example, the phrase “on the way to the airport” modifies the word ​kitten​. This may be                                   
interpreted as the kitten being the one going to the airport and Sheryl seeing it. To correct the                                   
sentence, the phrase should be placed next to ​Sheryl. This will transform the sentence to “On                               
the way to the airport, Sheryl saw a kitten.” 
 

We served a piece of chocolate brownie to our mother ​that is full of icing​. 

 
In this example, the sentence describes the mother as being covered with lots of icing as we                                 
give her a piece of chocolate brownie. To correct this sentence, move the clause next to                               
brownie​. The changed sentence will be, “We served a piece of chocolate brownie that is full of                                 
icing to our mother.”

The boy ate a cookie ​who has a mohawk​. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the cookie sports a mohawk hairstyle. The clause                             
must be connected to the noun it should modify, which is ​boy​. The sentence should be “The                                 
boy who has a mohawk ate a cookie.” 
 
 
Placement of Adverbs 
 
Take note that modifiers such as ​almost, nearly, only, just, ​slowly, and ​barely are often placed                               
incorrectly in sentences. Look at the following examples. 
 

My brother ​nearly​ swam for two hours. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the speaker’s brother did not really swim but                             
contemplated doing so for two hours. The use of the modifier ​nearly in this sentence is                               
wrongly placed and should be moved next to a more logical modified word. The sentence                             
should be “My brother swam for nearly two hours” so that the sentence would mean that the                                 
speaker’s brother swam for less than two hours. 
 

The agent ​almost​ earned P25,000.00 this afternoon. 

 
In this example, the agent did not earn the amount of money. To change this sentence, the                                 
modifier ​almost should be moved next to a more logical modified word, making the sentence:                             
“The agent earned almost P25,000.00 this afternoon.” 
 

The trainees ate the lunch that they had brought ​slowly​. 

 
In this example, the trainees brought lunch slowly. To change this sentence, the modifier                           
slowly should be moved next to a more logical modified word in the sentence. The correct                               
sentence should be: “The trainees slowly ate the lunch that they had brought.”

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the misplaced modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. The salesman almost made P50,000.00 today. 
2. The activity scarcely took an hour to complete. 
3. The regional director only has five minutes to talk with the guest. 
4. When they opened the leather woman’s bag, they found the missing keys. 
5. The farmers were spraying their crops wearing protective masks. 

 
 

Write ​C if the modifier in the sentence is in the correct position and ​X if it is                                   
misplaced. 

 
_____1. We made sure we will have cake from the vanilla woman. 
_____2. Dana was nearly shopping for two hours. 
_____3. Trevor tried to catch his slippery toad. 
_____4. The light shone through the thin wrapping. 
_____5.  The mother with the molten chocolate baked this birthday cake for me.  
 

 
Analyze the following sentences and revise them to correct the misplaced                     
modifiers. 

 
1. I tried eating a cold plate of oatmeal this morning. 
2. Their group hiked through the forest wearing only light shirts and shorts.

Lesson 2: Dangling Modifiers 
   

 
Not only can modifiers be         
misplaced but there are also         
times when the modified words         
cannot be found in the sentence.           
This lack of modified word(s)         
makes the modifier lose its         
connection to the sentence. Such modifiers are called               
dangling modifiers.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes                       
something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a                         
pronoun. Therefore, it is a ​modifier that has nothing to                   
describe​ ​or modify​.  
 
 
Correcting a Dangling Modifier 
 
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear                 
and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a                     
failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be                   
describing.  
 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must ​supply the                   
missing modified word to complete the thought of the                 
sentence​. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the                           
context of the sentence. 
 
Take a look at the following examples: 
 

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground. 

 
In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying ​water jug​. It may leave                                   
an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. To correct the sentence, leave the                               
modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the                                 
pronoun ​I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, ​I saw my                                 
water jug fall on the ground.” 
 
 
 
 

  10
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 

When six years old, my father went to law school. 

 
In this example, the phrase “when six years old” looks as if it modifies the noun ​father​. This                                   
may mean that the speaker’s father went to law school when he was six years old. To correct                                   
this dangling modifier, insert the noun or pronoun within the dangling modifier to make it a                               
dependent clause. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be “When ​I was six years old, my                             
father went to law school.” 
 

After showing my ticket, the gate opened. 

 
In this example, the modifier gives an impression that the gate automatically opened when                           
the speaker showed the ticket. This makes the meaning of the sentence confusing. A modified                             
word should be inserted to make the sentence logical. The revised sentence should be “After ​I                               
showed my ticket to the marshal​, the gate opened.” 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 

 

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the dangling modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. Leaving quickly, her car lights were left on. 
2. While exercising, my shirt tore. 
3. Once filled with ink, you can write for hours before the pen runs dry. 
4. Standing on the runway, a plane will hit you. 
5. Having done the dishes and vacuumed the floors, her house looked decent again.

Lesson 3: Parallel Structure of Words and 
Phrases 

 
Aside from the correct placement of           
modifiers, a sentence should also have a             
balanced form. The use of parallel           
structure in your writing will help you             
achieve this balance. You will learn           
more about this structure in this lesson.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​parallel structure means that certain parts of a sentence                   
have the same form and function. It allows the writer a smooth                       
and effective flow of his or her thoughts, making the sentences                     
grammatically correct. 
 
 
Parallel Structure Guidelines 
 
To make sure that the words and phrases in your sentences                     
have parallel structure, take note of the following guidelines: 
 
1. Words or phrases joined by coordinating conjunctions should                 
have the same structure. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and doesn’t smell very good. 
 
Parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and smelly.     

 
In this example, ​lonely​ and ​skinny​ are both adjectives. The last word in the series should thus 
have the same structure as the first two in the series. 
 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We enjoy writing, biking, and to cook. 
 
Parallel structure: We enjoy writing, biking, and cooking. 

 
In this example, ​writing​ and ​biking​ are both gerunds. The last word in the series should thus 
also be a gerund. 
 

 
 

  14
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We like to write, to swim, and doing the dishes. 
 
Parallel structure: We like to write, to swim, and to do the dishes. 
                                 We like to write, swim, and do the dishes. 

 
In this example, the series contains infinitives (to + verb). To make the elements parallel, the                               
series may have all verbs as infinitives or have the first verb in the series as an infinitive                                   
followed by the base form of the verb in the next verbs in the series. 
 
 
2. Use parallel structures with phrases joined by linking verbs or be verbs. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​To see is believing. 
 
Parallel structure: To see is to believe. 
                                 Seeing is believing. 

 
In this example, the first element should be completed by the second element. In order for                               
this to be parallel, the second element should have the same structure as the first element                               
and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: To succeed is making the most out of every opportunity. 
 
Parallel structure: To succeed is to make the most out of every opportunity. 
                                 Succeeding is making the most out of every opportunity. 

 
In this example, the first element, which is “To succeed,” is completed by the second element,                               
which is “making the most out of every opportunity.” To make this parallel, the second                             
element should have the same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 
 
Parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as being happy. 
                                 To be wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 

  15
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
 
In this example, the first element, which is “Being wealthy,” is completed by the second                             
element, which is “to be happy.” To make this parallel, the second element should have the                               
same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 
 
3. Elements joined by correlative conjunctions should also follow similar structure. Whatever                       
the structure of the first element should also be the structure of the element that follows it. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor go to church. 
 
Parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor going to church.   

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​neither-nor​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​neither​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​nor. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and it is educational. 
 
Parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and educational.     

 
In this example, the second element does not have the same structure as the first element. In                                 
order for the sentence to be parallel, the second element should follow the structure of the                               
first element. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or is she a member. 
 
Parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or a member.     

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​either-or​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​either​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​or.

_____3. We gathered outside, discussed the plan, and surprise. 
_____4. I stopped and am looking at the signs. 
_____5. Walter told me to eat oatmeal and drink water for three days. 
 

 
Analyze the following sentences and revise them to make the sentences parallel. 
 

1. The regimen not only helped me sleep better but also it makes me grow taller. 
2. It’s either work today or you will work next weekend. 
3. A good student must have excellence, discipline, and should be diligent. 
4. Their ideas are sound and of importance. 
5. The courses offered gives students ample opportunities and a variety of choices.

Lesson 4: Parallel Structure of Clauses 
   

 
In writing, the use of parallel           
structure is essential in order to           
achieve balance and clarity of         
ideas. In the previous lesson, we           
learned that some parts or         
elements of a sentence—words       
and phrases—that are similar in function should also be                 
similar in terms of structure. In this lesson, we will be dealing                       
with parallel structure of clauses.   

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Group Activity 
 
Form a group of four. Read and examine the sentence below. What does your group think 
about the sentence? Revise the sentence to make the clauses parallel.   

 

 
My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words. 

Revised sentence: 

 
 
Each member of the group should create a sentence about herself or himself. The sentence 
should be similar to the revised sentence in terms of structure. Share your sentences in class.

When a sentence has more than one clause, its clauses should                     
also have parallel structure. A change in the voice of verbs                     
makes its parallelism faulty. 
 
The parallel structure of clauses follows the same rules as the                     
parallel structure of words and phrases. Here are some                 
examples: 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​The people gossiped about who she was and her purpose of                           
attending the party. 
 
Parallel structure: The people gossiped about ​who she was​ and ​why she attended the party​. 

 
In this example, the second element “her purpose of attending the party” does not have the                               
same structure as the first element “who she was.” In order for the sentence to be parallel, the                                   
second element should follow the structure of the first element. In this case, “her purpose of                               
attending the party” should be changed to “why she attended the party.” 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​Please give us a tally of scores before the game ends or the referee                                 
announces the winner. 
 
Parallel structure: Please give us a tally of scores ​before the game ends or ​when the referee                                 
announces the winner​. 

 
In this example, the second element “the referee announces the winner” does not have the                             
same structure as the first element “before the game ends.” In order for the sentence to be                                 
parallel, “the referee announces the winner” should be changed to “when the referee                         
announces the winner.”

Faulty parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my                               
words. 
 
Parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on ​what I did​ or ​what I said​. 

 
In this example, the second element “my words” does not have the same structure as the first                                 
element “what I did.” To make the sentence parallel, “my words” should be changed to “what I                                 
said.” 
 
In all of the examples given, the second element should follow the structure of the first                               
element. In this case, the structure should be rewritten in clause form.

Analyze the following sentences and revise them to make the clauses parallel. 
 

1. You can borrow the car when no one uses it and no one needs it. 
2. Jannah is both happy about the promotion and she is nervous about the extra                           

responsibility. 
3. I made a choreography for a friend who trusts my capabilities and she knows my genre                               

well. 
4. That particular exercise both helped me lose to weight and it toned my muscles. 
5. My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words.  

 
Complete each sentence and make sure that the elements are parallel to one                         
another. After completing the sentences, compose a short essay using one of the                         
five sentences as your main topic.  

 
1. Being happy means not only __________________________________________________________. 
2. In my English class, I learned not only to speak well __________________________________. 
3. Success is not defined by  __________________________________. 
4. Most people like to talk about _________________________________.

Cohesion in Writing 
 
A ​modifier​ is a word or group of words that describe other words in the sentence. 
 
 
A modifier is ​misplaced if it is not placed right next to the word it describes. Having a                                   
misplaced modifier in a sentence will make it awkward, confusing, and illogical. 
 
 
A modifier is ​dangling​ if the word it modifies is not present in the sentence. 
 
 
A correct ​parallel structure requires the elements in a sentence to have the same form                             
and function for it to become balanced and grammatically correct.

Parallel Structure Guidelines
To make sure that the words and phrases in your sentences have parallel structure, take note of the following guidelines:
1) Words or phrases joined by coordinating conjunctions should have the same structure.
Faulty parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and doesn’t smell very good.
Parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and smelly. 
In this example, lonely and skinny are both adjectives. The last word in the series should thus have the same structure as the first two in the series.

2) Use parallel structures with phrases joined by linking verbs or be verbs.
Faulty parallel structure: To see is believing.
Parallel structure: To see is to believe.Seeing is believing.
In this example, the first element should be completed by the second element. In order for this to be parallel, the second element should have the same structure as the first element and vice versa.

3) Elements joined by correlative conjunctions should also follow similar structure. Whatever the structure of the first element should also be the structure of the element that follows it.
Faulty parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor go to church.
Parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor going to church. 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction neither-nor. The structure of the first phrase after neither should also be the structure of the phrase that follows nor.

UNIT 21    
Cohesion in Writing 
In meditation, we try to connect ourselves to               
our innermost thoughts and the calming           
presence of our surroundings. Writing is the             
same. It needs the same balance and harmony               
among its sentences and paragraphs to           
connect the ideas of the writer and to convey                 
them to his or her audience. Cohesion in               
writing requires the smooth flow of words,             
phrases, and sentences in order for the             
readers to understand the ideas the writer wants to convey. In this unit, we will discuss                               
important concepts related to cohesion. 
 
 

 

Unit Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
● use appropriate modifiers;  
● use parallel structures; and 
● compose an informative essay.

Lesson 1: Misplaced Modifiers 
   

A ​modifier is a word or group of words that                   
describes some other words in the sentence. Take               
a look at this sentence: “The man found a golden                   
ticket.” In this example, the word ​golden describes               
the noun ​ticket​. Modifiers are sometimes           
misplaced in a sentence, and this may cause               
confusion. This lesson will help you learn how to spot misplaced modifiers and                         
correct them. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Think-Pair-Share 
 
With a partner, examine the sentence below. What can you and your partner say about the                               
sentence? Are the modifiers appropriately used? Revise the sentence to make it clear and                           
logical. Share your sentence in class. 
 

 

 
The sales agent sold the picture to the petite lady in the wooden frame.

Learn About It!  
 

 
There are instances in which sentences have modifiers that are                   
wrongly placed. This may cause problems in identifying what the                   
modifier describes. When a modifier is not correctly placed, it is                     
called a misplaced modifier. ​Misplaced modifiers happen when               
the modifier is not placed right next to the word it modifies.                       
Because of this, a sentence will sound awkward, ridiculous, and                   
illogical. 
 
Here is an example. 

 

The ​leather​ man’s sweater is missing. 

 
In this example, ​leather describes the word ​man​. The problem is                     
that there is no such thing as a man made of leather. Therefore,                         
the word ​leather is a misplaced modifier. To correct this sentence,                     
leather should be moved to a more sensible place such as before                       
the word ​sweater​, which will make the sentence more logical. The                     
correct sentence should be “The man’s leather sweater is                 
missing.”  
 

Here is another example. 
 

The ​crumpled​ student’s uniform was ironed this morning. 

 
The sentence in this example is quite confusing because it means that the student is                             
described as crumpled. To correct this sentence, the word ​crumpled must be placed beside                           
the word ​uniform​. Hence, the sentence will become “The student’s crumpled uniform was                         
ironed this morning.”

Here is another example. 
 

The ​torn​ child’s book lay on the table. 

 
In this example, can you identify the misplaced modifier? What is the correct placement of the                               
modifier? What is the correct sentence? 
 
 
Phrase and Clause Modifiers 
 
Phrase and clause modifiers may also be misplaced. Look at the examples below: 
 

Loaded with sauce and meatballs​, Lucy ate spaghetti. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that Lucy is covered in sauce and meatballs as she ate                                 
spaghetti. This is an illogical sentence and will confuse the readers. To correct this sentence,                             
move the phrase “loaded with sauce and meatballs” next to ​spaghetti​, which is the word it                               
should modify. The sentence will now become “Lucy ate spaghetti loaded with sauce and                           
meatballs.” 
 

Sheryl saw a kitten ​on the way to the airport​. 

 
In this example, the phrase “on the way to the airport” modifies the word ​kitten​. This may be                                   
interpreted as the kitten being the one going to the airport and Sheryl seeing it. To correct the                                   
sentence, the phrase should be placed next to ​Sheryl. This will transform the sentence to “On                               
the way to the airport, Sheryl saw a kitten.” 
 

We served a piece of chocolate brownie to our mother ​that is full of icing​. 

 
In this example, the sentence describes the mother as being covered with lots of icing as we                                 
give her a piece of chocolate brownie. To correct this sentence, move the clause next to                               
brownie​. The changed sentence will be, “We served a piece of chocolate brownie that is full of                                 
icing to our mother.” 
 

  5
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
 

The boy ate a cookie ​who has a mohawk​. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the cookie sports a mohawk hairstyle. The clause                             
must be connected to the noun it should modify, which is ​boy​. The sentence should be “The                                 
boy who has a mohawk ate a cookie.” 
 
 
Placement of Adverbs 
 
Take note that modifiers such as ​almost, nearly, only, just, ​slowly, and ​barely are often placed                               
incorrectly in sentences. Look at the following examples. 
 

My brother ​nearly​ swam for two hours. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the speaker’s brother did not really swim but                             
contemplated doing so for two hours. The use of the modifier ​nearly in this sentence is                               
wrongly placed and should be moved next to a more logical modified word. The sentence                             
should be “My brother swam for nearly two hours” so that the sentence would mean that the                                 
speaker’s brother swam for less than two hours. 
 

The agent ​almost​ earned P25,000.00 this afternoon. 

 
In this example, the agent did not earn the amount of money. To change this sentence, the                                 
modifier ​almost should be moved next to a more logical modified word, making the sentence:                             
“The agent earned almost P25,000.00 this afternoon.” 
 

The trainees ate the lunch that they had brought ​slowly​. 

 
In this example, the trainees brought lunch slowly. To change this sentence, the modifier                           
slowly should be moved next to a more logical modified word in the sentence. The correct                               
sentence should be: “The trainees slowly ate the lunch that they had brought.”

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the misplaced modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. The salesman almost made P50,000.00 today. 
2. The activity scarcely took an hour to complete. 
3. The regional director only has five minutes to talk with the guest. 
4. When they opened the leather woman’s bag, they found the missing keys. 
5. The farmers were spraying their crops wearing protective masks. 

 
 

Write ​C if the modifier in the sentence is in the correct position and ​X if it is                                   
misplaced. 

 
_____1. We made sure we will have cake from the vanilla woman. 
_____2. Dana was nearly shopping for two hours. 
_____3. Trevor tried to catch his slippery toad. 
_____4. The light shone through the thin wrapping. 
_____5.  The mother with the molten chocolate baked this birthday cake for me.  
 

 
Analyze the following sentences and revise them to correct the misplaced                     
modifiers. 

 
1. I tried eating a cold plate of oatmeal this morning. 
2. Their group hiked through the forest wearing only light shirts and shorts. 
3. She found the latex woman’s gloves in the cabinet.

Lesson 2: Dangling Modifiers 
   

 
Not only can modifiers be         
misplaced but there are also         
times when the modified words         
cannot be found in the sentence.           
This lack of modified word(s)         
makes the modifier lose its         
connection to the sentence. Such modifiers are called               
dangling modifiers.

A ​dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes                       
something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a                         
pronoun. Therefore, it is a ​modifier that has nothing to                   
describe​ ​or modify​.  
 
 
Correcting a Dangling Modifier 
 
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear                 
and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a                     
failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be                   
describing.  
 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must ​supply the                   
missing modified word to complete the thought of the                 
sentence​. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the                           
context of the sentence. 
 
Take a look at the following examples: 
 

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground. 

 
In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying ​water jug​. It may leave                                   
an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. To correct the sentence, leave the                               
modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the                                 
pronoun ​I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, ​I saw my                                 
water jug fall on the ground.”

When six years old, my father went to law school. 

 
In this example, the phrase “when six years old” looks as if it modifies the noun ​father​. This                                   
may mean that the speaker’s father went to law school when he was six years old. To correct                                   
this dangling modifier, insert the noun or pronoun within the dangling modifier to make it a                               
dependent clause. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be “When ​I was six years old, my                             
father went to law school.” 
 

After showing my ticket, the gate opened. 

 
In this example, the modifier gives an impression that the gate automatically opened when                           
the speaker showed the ticket. This makes the meaning of the sentence confusing. A modified                             
word should be inserted to make the sentence logical. The revised sentence should be “After ​I                               
showed my ticket to the marshal​, the gate opened.” 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 

 

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the dangling modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. Leaving quickly, her car lights were left on. 
2. While exercising, my shirt tore. 
3. Once filled with ink, you can write for hours before the pen runs dry. 
4. Standing on the runway, a plane will hit you. 
5. Having done the dishes and vacuumed the floors, her house looked decent again.

Analyze the following sentences and revise them to correct the dangling                     
modifiers. 

 
1. Reading the magazine, an article on the latest gadgets caught my eye.  
2. When just five years old, an old lady saved my life. 
3. Playing soccer for the first time, the game was too strenuous for Kiel. 
4. After explaining that I had lost my purse, the waiter allowed me to pay by check. 
5. While looking at the clues, the pieces of paper flew out the window. 

 
Use the following modifiers to make a complete sentence. Follow the rules on 
avoiding dangling modifiers. 
 

1. Entering college, _____________________________________________________________. 
2. After waking up, _____________________________________________________________. 
3. Before the night is over, _____________________________________________________. 
4. While reading a book, _______________________________________________________.

Lesson 3: Parallel Structure of Words and 
Phrases 

 
Aside from the correct placement of           
modifiers, a sentence should also have a             
balanced form. The use of parallel           
structure in your writing will help you             
achieve this balance. You will learn           
more about this structure in this lesson. 
 

 

 
Warm-up!

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​parallel structure means that certain parts of a sentence                   
have the same form and function. It allows the writer a smooth                       
and effective flow of his or her thoughts, making the sentences                     
grammatically correct. 
 
 
Parallel Structure Guidelines 
 
To make sure that the words and phrases in your sentences                     
have parallel structure, take note of the following guidelines: 
 
1. Words or phrases joined by coordinating conjunctions should                 
have the same structure. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and doesn’t smell very good. 
 
Parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and smelly.     

 
In this example, ​lonely​ and ​skinny​ are both adjectives. The last word in the series should thus 
have the same structure as the first two in the series. 
 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We enjoy writing, biking, and to cook. 
 
Parallel structure: We enjoy writing, biking, and cooking. 

 
In this example, ​writing​ and ​biking​ are both gerunds. The last word in the series should thus 
also be a gerund.

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We like to write, to swim, and doing the dishes. 
 
Parallel structure: We like to write, to swim, and to do the dishes. 
                                 We like to write, swim, and do the dishes. 

 
In this example, the series contains infinitives (to + verb). To make the elements parallel, the                               
series may have all verbs as infinitives or have the first verb in the series as an infinitive                                   
followed by the base form of the verb in the next verbs in the series. 
 
 
2. Use parallel structures with phrases joined by linking verbs or be verbs. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​To see is believing. 
 
Parallel structure: To see is to believe. 
                                 Seeing is believing. 

 
In this example, the first element should be completed by the second element. In order for                               
this to be parallel, the second element should have the same structure as the first element                               
and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: To succeed is making the most out of every opportunity. 
 
Parallel structure: To succeed is to make the most out of every opportunity. 
                                 Succeeding is making the most out of every opportunity. 

 
In this example, the first element, which is “To succeed,” is completed by the second element,                               
which is “making the most out of every opportunity.” To make this parallel, the second                             
element should have the same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 
 
Parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as being happy. 
                                 To be wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 

  15

In this example, the first element, which is “Being wealthy,” is completed by the second                             
element, which is “to be happy.” To make this parallel, the second element should have the                               
same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 
 
3. Elements joined by correlative conjunctions should also follow similar structure. Whatever                       
the structure of the first element should also be the structure of the element that follows it. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor go to church. 
 
Parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor going to church.   

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​neither-nor​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​neither​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​nor. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and it is educational. 
 
Parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and educational.     

 
In this example, the second element does not have the same structure as the first element. In                                 
order for the sentence to be parallel, the second element should follow the structure of the                               
first element. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or is she a member. 
 
Parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or a member.     

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​either-or​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​either​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​or.

Lesson 4: Parallel Structure of Clauses 
   

 
In writing, the use of parallel           
structure is essential in order to           
achieve balance and clarity of         
ideas. In the previous lesson, we           
learned that some parts or         
elements of a sentence—words       
and phrases—that are similar in function should also be                 
similar in terms of structure. In this lesson, we will be dealing                       
with parallel structure of clauses.   

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Group Activity 
 
Form a group of four. Read and examine the sentence below. What does your group think 
about the sentence? Revise the sentence to make the clauses parallel.   

 

 
My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words. 

Revised sentence: 

 
 
Each member of the group should create a sentence about herself or himself. The sentence 
should be similar to the revised sentence in terms of structure. Share your sentences in class.

Learn About It!  
 

 
When a sentence has more than one clause, its clauses should                     
also have parallel structure. A change in the voice of verbs                     
makes its parallelism faulty. 
 
The parallel structure of clauses follows the same rules as the                     
parallel structure of words and phrases. Here are some                 
examples: 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​The people gossiped about who she was and her purpose of                           
attending the party. 
 
Parallel structure: The people gossiped about ​who she was​ and ​why she attended the party​. 

 
In this example, the second element “her purpose of attending the party” does not have the                               
same structure as the first element “who she was.” In order for the sentence to be parallel, the                                   
second element should follow the structure of the first element. In this case, “her purpose of                               
attending the party” should be changed to “why she attended the party.” 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​Please give us a tally of scores before the game ends or the referee                                 
announces the winner. 
 
Parallel structure: Please give us a tally of scores ​before the game ends or ​when the referee                                 
announces the winner​. 

 
In this example, the second element “the referee announces the winner” does not have the                             
same structure as the first element “before the game ends.” In order for the sentence to be                                 
parallel, “the referee announces the winner” should be changed to “when the referee                         
announces the winner.”

Faulty parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my                               
words. 
 
Parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on ​what I did​ or ​what I said​. 

 
In this example, the second element “my words” does not have the same structure as the first                                 
element “what I did.” To make the sentence parallel, “my words” should be changed to “what I                                 
said.” 
 
In all of the examples given, the second element should follow the structure of the first                               
element. In this case, the structure should be rewritten in clause form. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Write ​C​ if the sentence is parallel and ​X​ if it is not. 

 
____1. Darrien who administered the test and he finished the paperwork went out 
earlier. 
____2. Allow us to look into why this happened and when we can solve the issue. 
____3. Do not make me tell them who made a mistake and the series of events. 
____4. I was wondering who she was and what she was doing here. 
____5. Robin gave us bread before the game and at the end of the game.

Analyze the following sentences and revise them to make the clauses parallel. 
 

1. You can borrow the car when no one uses it and no one needs it. 
2. Jannah is both happy about the promotion and she is nervous about the extra                           

responsibility.

well. 
4. That particular exercise both helped me lose to weight and it toned my muscles. 
5. My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words.  

 
Complete each sentence and make sure that the elements are parallel to one                         
another. After completing the sentences, compose a short essay using one of the                         
five sentences as your main topic.  

 
1. Being happy means not only __________________________________________________________. 
2. In my English class, I learned not only to speak well __________________________________. 
3. Success is not defined by  __________________________________.

Wrap Up 
 

Cohesion in Writing 
 
A ​modifier​ is a word or group of words that describe other words in the sentence. 
 
 
A modifier is ​misplaced if it is not placed right next to the word it describes. Having a                                   
misplaced modifier in a sentence will make it awkward, confusing, and illogical. 
 
 
A modifier is ​dangling​ if the word it modifies is not present in the sentence. 
 
 
A correct ​parallel structure requires the elements in a sentence to have the same form                             
and function for it to become balanced and grammatically correct.

In this example, the second element “her purpose of attending the party” does not have the same structure as the first element “who she was.” In order for the sentence to be parallel, the second element should follow the structure of the first element. In this case, “her purpose of attending the party” should be changed to “why she attended the party.”

UNIT 21    
Cohesion in Writing 
In meditation, we try to connect ourselves to               
our innermost thoughts and the calming           
presence of our surroundings. Writing is the             
same. It needs the same balance and harmony               
among its sentences and paragraphs to           
connect the ideas of the writer and to convey                 
them to his or her audience. Cohesion in               
writing requires the smooth flow of words,             
phrases, and sentences in order for the             
readers to understand the ideas the writer wants to convey. In this unit, we will discuss                               
important concepts related to cohesion. 
 
 

 

Unit Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
● use appropriate modifiers;  
● use parallel structures; and 
● compose an informative essay.

Lesson 1: Misplaced Modifiers 
   

A ​modifier is a word or group of words that                   
describes some other words in the sentence. Take               
a look at this sentence: “The man found a golden                   
ticket.” In this example, the word ​golden describes               
the noun ​ticket​. Modifiers are sometimes           
misplaced in a sentence, and this may cause               
confusion. This lesson will help you learn how to spot misplaced modifiers and                         
correct them. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Think-Pair-Share 
 
With a partner, examine the sentence below. What can you and your partner say about the                               
sentence? Are the modifiers appropriately used? Revise the sentence to make it clear and                           
logical. Share your sentence in class. 
 

 

 
The sales agent sold the picture to the petite lady in the wooden frame.

Learn About It!  
 

 
There are instances in which sentences have modifiers that are                   
wrongly placed. This may cause problems in identifying what the                   
modifier describes. When a modifier is not correctly placed, it is                     
called a misplaced modifier. ​Misplaced modifiers happen when               
the modifier is not placed right next to the word it modifies.                       
Because of this, a sentence will sound awkward, ridiculous, and                   
illogical. 
 
Here is an example. 

 

The ​leather​ man’s sweater is missing. 

 
In this example, ​leather describes the word ​man​. The problem is                     
that there is no such thing as a man made of leather. Therefore,                         
the word ​leather is a misplaced modifier. To correct this sentence,                     
leather should be moved to a more sensible place such as before                       
the word ​sweater​, which will make the sentence more logical. The                     
correct sentence should be “The man’s leather sweater is                 
missing.”  
 

Here is another example. 
 

The ​crumpled​ student’s uniform was ironed this morning. 

 
The sentence in this example is quite confusing because it means that the student is                             
described as crumpled. To correct this sentence, the word ​crumpled must be placed beside                           
the word ​uniform​. Hence, the sentence will become “The student’s crumpled uniform was                         
ironed this morning.”

Here is another example. 
 

The ​torn​ child’s book lay on the table. 

 
In this example, can you identify the misplaced modifier? What is the correct placement of the                               
modifier? What is the correct sentence? 
 
 
Phrase and Clause Modifiers 
 
Phrase and clause modifiers may also be misplaced. Look at the examples below: 
 

Loaded with sauce and meatballs​, Lucy ate spaghetti. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that Lucy is covered in sauce and meatballs as she ate                                 
spaghetti. This is an illogical sentence and will confuse the readers. To correct this sentence,                             
move the phrase “loaded with sauce and meatballs” next to ​spaghetti​, which is the word it                               
should modify. The sentence will now become “Lucy ate spaghetti loaded with sauce and                           
meatballs.” 
 

Sheryl saw a kitten ​on the way to the airport​. 

 
In this example, the phrase “on the way to the airport” modifies the word ​kitten​. This may be                                   
interpreted as the kitten being the one going to the airport and Sheryl seeing it. To correct the                                   
sentence, the phrase should be placed next to ​Sheryl. This will transform the sentence to “On                               
the way to the airport, Sheryl saw a kitten.” 
 

We served a piece of chocolate brownie to our mother ​that is full of icing​. 

 
In this example, the sentence describes the mother as being covered with lots of icing as we                                 
give her a piece of chocolate brownie. To correct this sentence, move the clause next to                               
brownie​. The changed sentence will be, “We served a piece of chocolate brownie that is full of                                 
icing to our mother.”

The boy ate a cookie ​who has a mohawk​. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the cookie sports a mohawk hairstyle. The clause                             
must be connected to the noun it should modify, which is ​boy​. The sentence should be “The                                 
boy who has a mohawk ate a cookie.” 
 
 
Placement of Adverbs 
 
Take note that modifiers such as ​almost, nearly, only, just, ​slowly, and ​barely are often placed                               
incorrectly in sentences. Look at the following examples. 
 

My brother ​nearly​ swam for two hours. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the speaker’s brother did not really swim but                             
contemplated doing so for two hours. The use of the modifier ​nearly in this sentence is                               
wrongly placed and should be moved next to a more logical modified word. The sentence                             
should be “My brother swam for nearly two hours” so that the sentence would mean that the                                 
speaker’s brother swam for less than two hours. 
 

The agent ​almost​ earned P25,000.00 this afternoon. 

 
In this example, the agent did not earn the amount of money. To change this sentence, the                                 
modifier ​almost should be moved next to a more logical modified word, making the sentence:                             
“The agent earned almost P25,000.00 this afternoon.” 
 

The trainees ate the lunch that they had brought ​slowly​. 

 
In this example, the trainees brought lunch slowly. To change this sentence, the modifier                           
slowly should be moved next to a more logical modified word in the sentence. The correct                               
sentence should be: “The trainees slowly ate the lunch that they had brought.”

4. When they opened the leather woman’s bag, they found the missing keys. 
5. The farmers were spraying their crops wearing protective masks.

misplaced.

Lesson 2: Dangling Modifiers 
   

 
Not only can modifiers be         
misplaced but there are also         
times when the modified words         
cannot be found in the sentence.           
This lack of modified word(s)         
makes the modifier lose its         
connection to the sentence. Such modifiers are called               
dangling modifiers.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes                       
something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a                         
pronoun. Therefore, it is a ​modifier that has nothing to                   
describe​ ​or modify​.  
 
 
Correcting a Dangling Modifier 
 
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear                 
and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a                     
failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be                   
describing.  
 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must ​supply the                   
missing modified word to complete the thought of the                 
sentence​. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the                           
context of the sentence. 
 
Take a look at the following examples: 
 

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground. 

 
In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying ​water jug​. It may leave                                   
an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. To correct the sentence, leave the                               
modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the                                 
pronoun ​I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, ​I saw my                                 
water jug fall on the ground.” 
 
 
 
 

  10
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 

When six years old, my father went to law school. 

 
In this example, the phrase “when six years old” looks as if it modifies the noun ​father​. This                                   
may mean that the speaker’s father went to law school when he was six years old. To correct                                   
this dangling modifier, insert the noun or pronoun within the dangling modifier to make it a                               
dependent clause. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be “When ​I was six years old, my                             
father went to law school.” 
 

After showing my ticket, the gate opened. 

 
In this example, the modifier gives an impression that the gate automatically opened when                           
the speaker showed the ticket. This makes the meaning of the sentence confusing. A modified                             
word should be inserted to make the sentence logical. The revised sentence should be “After ​I                               
showed my ticket to the marshal​, the gate opened.” 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 

 

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the dangling modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. Leaving quickly, her car lights were left on. 
2. While exercising, my shirt tore. 
3. Once filled with ink, you can write for hours before the pen runs dry. 
4. Standing on the runway, a plane will hit you. 
5. Having done the dishes and vacuumed the floors, her house looked decent again.

Lesson 3: Parallel Structure of Words and 
Phrases 

 
Aside from the correct placement of           
modifiers, a sentence should also have a             
balanced form. The use of parallel           
structure in your writing will help you             
achieve this balance. You will learn           
more about this structure in this lesson.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​parallel structure means that certain parts of a sentence                   
have the same form and function. It allows the writer a smooth                       
and effective flow of his or her thoughts, making the sentences                     
grammatically correct. 
 
 
Parallel Structure Guidelines 
 
To make sure that the words and phrases in your sentences                     
have parallel structure, take note of the following guidelines: 
 
1. Words or phrases joined by coordinating conjunctions should                 
have the same structure. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and doesn’t smell very good. 
 
Parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and smelly.     

 
In this example, ​lonely​ and ​skinny​ are both adjectives. The last word in the series should thus 
have the same structure as the first two in the series. 
 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We enjoy writing, biking, and to cook. 
 
Parallel structure: We enjoy writing, biking, and cooking. 

 
In this example, ​writing​ and ​biking​ are both gerunds. The last word in the series should thus 
also be a gerund. 
 

 
 

  14
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We like to write, to swim, and doing the dishes. 
 
Parallel structure: We like to write, to swim, and to do the dishes. 
                                 We like to write, swim, and do the dishes. 

 
In this example, the series contains infinitives (to + verb). To make the elements parallel, the                               
series may have all verbs as infinitives or have the first verb in the series as an infinitive                                   
followed by the base form of the verb in the next verbs in the series. 
 
 
2. Use parallel structures with phrases joined by linking verbs or be verbs. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​To see is believing. 
 
Parallel structure: To see is to believe. 
                                 Seeing is believing. 

 
In this example, the first element should be completed by the second element. In order for                               
this to be parallel, the second element should have the same structure as the first element                               
and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: To succeed is making the most out of every opportunity. 
 
Parallel structure: To succeed is to make the most out of every opportunity. 
                                 Succeeding is making the most out of every opportunity. 

 
In this example, the first element, which is “To succeed,” is completed by the second element,                               
which is “making the most out of every opportunity.” To make this parallel, the second                             
element should have the same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 
 
Parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as being happy. 
                                 To be wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 

  15
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
 
In this example, the first element, which is “Being wealthy,” is completed by the second                             
element, which is “to be happy.” To make this parallel, the second element should have the                               
same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 
 
3. Elements joined by correlative conjunctions should also follow similar structure. Whatever                       
the structure of the first element should also be the structure of the element that follows it. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor go to church. 
 
Parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor going to church.   

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​neither-nor​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​neither​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​nor. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and it is educational. 
 
Parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and educational.     

 
In this example, the second element does not have the same structure as the first element. In                                 
order for the sentence to be parallel, the second element should follow the structure of the                               
first element. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or is she a member. 
 
Parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or a member.     

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​either-or​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​either​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​or.

Lesson 4: Parallel Structure of Clauses 
   

 
In writing, the use of parallel           
structure is essential in order to           
achieve balance and clarity of         
ideas. In the previous lesson, we           
learned that some parts or         
elements of a sentence—words       
and phrases—that are similar in function should also be                 
similar in terms of structure. In this lesson, we will be dealing                       
with parallel structure of clauses.   

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Group Activity 
 
Form a group of four. Read and examine the sentence below. What does your group think 
about the sentence? Revise the sentence to make the clauses parallel.   

 

 
My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words. 

Revised sentence: 

 
 
Each member of the group should create a sentence about herself or himself. The sentence 
should be similar to the revised sentence in terms of structure. Share your sentences in class.

Learn About It!  
 

 
When a sentence has more than one clause, its clauses should                     
also have parallel structure. A change in the voice of verbs                     
makes its parallelism faulty. 
 
The parallel structure of clauses follows the same rules as the                     
parallel structure of words and phrases. Here are some                 
examples: 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​The people gossiped about who she was and her purpose of                           
attending the party. 
 
Parallel structure: The people gossiped about ​who she was​ and ​why she attended the party​. 

 
In this example, the second element “her purpose of attending the party” does not have the                               
same structure as the first element “who she was.” In order for the sentence to be parallel, the                                   
second element should follow the structure of the first element. In this case, “her purpose of                               
attending the party” should be changed to “why she attended the party.” 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​Please give us a tally of scores before the game ends or the referee                                 
announces the winner. 
 
Parallel structure: Please give us a tally of scores ​before the game ends or ​when the referee                                 
announces the winner​. 

 
In this example, the second element “the referee announces the winner” does not have the                             
same structure as the first element “before the game ends.” In order for the sentence to be                                 
parallel, “the referee announces the winner” should be changed to “when the referee                         
announces the winner.”

Faulty parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my                               
words. 
 
Parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on ​what I did​ or ​what I said​. 

 
In this example, the second element “my words” does not have the same structure as the first                                 
element “what I did.” To make the sentence parallel, “my words” should be changed to “what I                                 
said.” 
 
In all of the examples given, the second element should follow the structure of the first                               
element. In this case, the structure should be rewritten in clause form.

well. 
4. That particular exercise both helped me lose to weight and it toned my muscles. 
5. My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words.  

 
Complete each sentence and make sure that the elements are parallel to one                         
another. After completing the sentences, compose a short essay using one of the                         
five sentences as your main topic.

Cohesion in Writing 
 
A ​modifier​ is a word or group of words that describe other words in the sentence. 
 
 
A modifier is ​misplaced if it is not placed right next to the word it describes. Having a                                   
misplaced modifier in a sentence will make it awkward, confusing, and illogical. 
 
 
A modifier is ​dangling​ if the word it modifies is not present in the sentence. 
 
 
A correct ​parallel structure requires the elements in a sentence to have the same form                             
and function for it to become balanced and grammatically correct.

When people state arguments, they give a reason or set of reasons in order to persuade others that an action or idea is right or wrong.
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in forming their arguments. These errors are called fallacies. They can either be committed deliberately in order to deceive or persuade people to do something, or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

Types of Fallacies:

Formal fallacy -  refers to the mistake in the logical structure of the argument, especially if the premise, or an assertion, belief, or assumption, does not logically connect with the conclusion.
Informal fallacy - is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of irrelevant information.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

Learn About It!  
 

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

 Check Your Understanding  
 

Identify what fallacy of ethos is committed in each statement. Write the letter of your answer. 
 

A. Appeal to authority 
B. Appeal to person 
C. Strawperson 

 
1. I will not stop smoking as the president of the country smokes himself. 
2. The lawmakers who wanted death penalty re-implemented are not Christians. 
3. Sarah Geronimo says she maintains her smooth and fair skin because of Dra. Belo; I’d                             

better go to her to have my skin taken care of, too.  I will surely be as beautiful as Sarah. 
4. Ferdinand Marcos’ grandchildren should never be allowed to run for office because of                         

how their grandfather abused our economic resources. 
5. That toothpaste is certainly the best because the my dentist neighbor already said so.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Wrap Up 
 

● Fallacies ​are errors in argumentation that can either be ​formal ​(based on the                         
argument’s ​premises ​and conclusion) or ​informal ​(based on the language and the                       
validity ​of the evidences used). 

● Fallacies can be of ​logos ​(reasoning), ethos ​(character)​, or ​pathos (emotions). Below are                         
different types under each fallacy: 

 

Fallacies of Logos  Fallacies of  Ethos  Fallacies of Pathos 

Circular reasoning  Appeal to authority  Argument to the people

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

Learn About It!  
 

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Types of Monologue

Soliloquy

A** soliloquy** is a monologue that shows the character talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the audience and at times the figures present in that particular scene can hear what the character says, but he is unaware of those who can overhear him. 
An example of a soliloquy is the Balcony scene in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”:

“O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.”


Dramatic Monologue

A dramatic monologue is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals his traits and intentions that is relevant to the plot of the story.
An example of a dramatic monologue is Robert Browning’s “The Last Duchess”:

She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.


Internal Monologue

An internal monologue is usually found in written texts such as novels and short stories or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed. Through internal monologue (also known as “stream of consciousness”), the readers can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can be identified through italicized texts; and in TV and movies, internal monologue can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts”.

Features of a Dramatic Monologue

It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct from the poet.
It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear directly in the poem.
It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality.
It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as you see, well, etc., or of deictics like here, there, that, this, etc.
It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s  life.
It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits of one’s own self and experience.
It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the human mind and heart.

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 
Check Your Understanding  
 

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

Types of Monologue

Soliloquy

A** soliloquy** is a monologue that shows the character talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the audience and at times the figures present in that particular scene can hear what the character says, but he is unaware of those who can overhear him. 
An example of a soliloquy is the Balcony scene in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”:

“O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.”


Dramatic Monologue

A dramatic monologue is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals his traits and intentions that is relevant to the plot of the story.
An example of a dramatic monologue is Robert Browning’s “The Last Duchess”:

She had
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.


Internal Monologue

An internal monologue is usually found in written texts such as novels and short stories or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed. Through internal monologue (also known as “stream of consciousness”), the readers can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can be identified through italicized texts; and in TV and movies, internal monologue can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts”.

Importance of Monologue
Monologues allow the readers to gain insight on who the character is through their innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring their actions and behavior in the entire story.

It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s  life.
It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits of one’s own self and experience.
It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the human mind and heart.

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4

to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue. 
 

 
Warm-up!

and as believable as possible. 

● Name  
● Nickname 
● Age 
● Residence and type of neighborhood  
● Birthplace  
● Height  
● Body type 
● Distinct features  
● Health condition  
● Type of clothes

good at it? Is she or he happy with his 
or her present work? What is his or 
her working relationship with the 
people around him or her?)

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 
Check Your Understanding  
 

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

UNIT 20    
Monologue 
 
When characters reveal a part of themselves in a story, their innermost thoughts and motives                             
become a medium to reveal a powerful message. These play an important part in the flow of                                 
the story, justifying the characters’ actions as well. In this unit, we will learn about the                               
monologue: a means of expressing such inner ideas. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

 
In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● get familiar with the technical vocabulary for drama 
and theater;  

● use a concept map to outline ideas; 
● analyze the stand of the speaker based on the explicit 

statement made;  
● explain the literary devices used; and   
● compose and deliver a monologue.

Lesson 1: What Is a Monologue? 
   

 
In ancient Greek theater, the origin of western drama, it                   
started with only a single actor who would appear onstage                   
along with the chorus. Eventually, this evolved into having two                   
or more actors together onstage. Ancient Roman theater               
featured monologues more extensively than Ancient Greek             
theater. The key purpose of monologues then was to indicate                   
the passage of significant amounts of time within scenes.                 
From renaissance theater onward, monologues became used for characters to use dramatic                       
speech to illustrate their inner thoughts and feelings.  
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

 
One-Minute Acting 
 
Imagine this: One night, you were walking in the middle of a dark alley. Suddenly, your foot                                 
got caught on a strange, dirty, sack-like bag. You leaned down to look at the bag and was                                   
surprised to see huge piles of money in it. What would have been your reaction? Write down                                 
the thoughts that would have been running in your mind.

Learn About It!  
 

A ​monologue ​is a speech that presents the words and                   
innermost thoughts of a single author. A ​monologist ​is a                   
person who delivers a monologue. Monologues present             
ideas, thoughts, and motives by a speaker through verbal and                   
nonverbal elements such as facial expressions and gestures. 
 
A. Types of Monologue 

Monologues have different types according to how it is 
presented. These are: 
 
1. Soliloquy 

A soliloquy is a monologue that shows the character                 
talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the                   
audience, and at times, the figures present in that                 
particular scene, can hear what the character says, but                 
the character is unaware of those who can overhear                 
him. 
 
An example of a soliloquy is the balcony scene in Shakespeare’s ​Romeo and Juliet​ where 
Juliet is expressing her thoughts upon discovering that Romeo is a Montague: 
 

O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? 
Deny thy father and refuse thy name; 
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, 
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

 
In this example, Juliet believes she is alone in the balcony but the audience knows that 
Romeo is listening intently to everything she is saying. 
 

2. Dramatic Monologue 
A dramatic monologue ​is a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly                           

  4
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals                         
his or her traits and intentions that are relevant to the plot of the story. 
An example of a dramatic monologue is in Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” where                           
the duke talks to guests in his home about his late duchess as they admire a portrait of                                   
her. 
 

She had 
A heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad, 
Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er 
She looked on, and her looks went everywhere. 

 
In this example, the duke is describing how the duchess had a personality where she                             
became easily overjoyed and appreciative of the things around her. She also had a                           
fascination with everything she saw. 
 

3. Internal Monologue 
An internal monologue ​is usually found in written texts such as novels and short                           
stories, or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed.                       
Through internal monologue (also known as a “stream of consciousness”), the readers                       
can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can                           
be identified through italicized texts. In television shows and movies, internal                     
monologues can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts.” 

 
B. Importance of Monologue 

A monologue allows the readers to gain insight into who the characters are through their                             
innermost thoughts and motives. It creates an idea in the audience’s minds about what the                             
character’s mindset is and how this can help in inferring the character’s actions and                           
behavior in the entire story. 

 
C. Features of a Dramatic Monologue 

● It observes the use of the first-person pronoun “I” that stands for the persona, distinct                             
from the poet. 

● It uses verbs or expressions that refer to a listener or interlocutor who does not appear                               
directly in the poem. 

● It sometimes incorporates colloquialism with different levels of formality. 
● It contains dramatic rather than lyrical language through the use of fillers such as ​you                             

  5

see, well,​ etc., or of deictics like ​here, there, that, this,​ etc. 

● It presents the revelation of a personality occuring at a critical point in the speaker’s                             
life. 

● It reveals a marked interest in human psychology and the need to go beyond the limits                               
of one’s own self and experience. 

● It is an instrument for a poet’s investigation into the variety and complexity of the                             
human mind and heart.

Lesson 2: Analyzing a Character for a 
Monologue 

   
A monologue reveals the character’s real thoughts and insights                 
in a story. It is important to analyze what he or she says to                           
understand him or her further; this requires character               
analysis. In this lesson, you will learn how to analyze a                     
character based on information gleaned from a monologue.

good at it? Is she or he happy with his 
or her present work? What is his or 
her working relationship with the 
people around him or her?)

A ​character analysis is important especially in identifying and                 
immersing yourself into the character’s personality and traits.               
Through the monologue, these traits may become clearer to                 
the reader or listener, which can help with giving perspective                   
on the actions and behavior of the character.  
 
The following guide questions may help you in understanding                 
the character behind the monologue: 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges? 

 
Take a look at the following example of a monologue. 
 

Alice: I say, Mr. White Rabbit, where are you going? Hmmm. He won't answer me. And I do so                                     
want to know what he is late for. I wonder if I might follow him. Why not? There's no rule that I                                           
mayn't go where I please. I-I will follow him. Wait for me, Mr. White Rabbit. I'm coming, too!                                   
(Falling) How curious. I never realized that rabbit holes were so dark . . . and so long . . . and so                                             
empty. I believe I have been falling for five minutes, and I still can't see the bottom! Hmph! After                                     
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling downstairs. How brave they'll all think me at                                     
home. Why, I wouldn't say anything about it even if I fell off the top of the house! I wonder how                                         
many miles I've fallen by this time. I must be getting somewhere near the center of the earth. I                                     
wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny that would be. Oh, I think I see the                                       
bottom. Yes, I'm sure I see the bottom. I shall hit the bottom, hit it very hard, and oh, how it will                                           
hurt! 

 
In this example, Alice is having an internal monologue. You can tell from the words used that                                 
she is talking to herself as she falls down a rabbit hole, which she fell in after chasing the

white rabbit. She seems relatively calm as she falls, so the reader can infer that she is a brave                                     
and level-headed girl. 
 
Another way to analyze a character is through a character map. A ​character map helps in                               
identifying and understanding a character on a deeper level. It also shows how a character                             
affects the details in a story. Here is an example of a character map: 
 

CHARACTER MAP 
Title: Down the Rabbit Hole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this example, the monologue is analyzed through the use of the character map by                             
answering the questions given. The map is based completely on the monologue and makes                           
inferences based on the words the character uses. The map helps the reader or listener lay

out all the available information and gain new insight into the character.

Read the monologue below. Analyze the given character, and answer the questions that                         
follow. 
 

 
 

1. What is the main idea behind the monologue? 
2. What is the tone and mood of the monologue? 
3. To whom is the monologue spoken? 
4. What are the character’s goals or objectives? 
5. What challenges did the character face? How did he or she solve these challenges?

Lesson 3: Writing a Monologue 
   

Writing a monologue also requires research and preparation.               
Based on what you learned from the previous lessons, a                   
monologue must give insight into the thoughts and intentions                 
of a character. You must make sure to use words that express                       
these clearly. This lesson will help you in creating a                   
monologue that is not only effective but also well planned and                     
thought of.

My Character’s Voice 
 
Internalize the character you created in the ​Warm-up! ​Of Lesson 2. Pretend your character                           
finds himself or herself in the situation given in Lesson 1’s                     
Warm-up! activity. Create an internal dialogue out of the given                   
scenario. 
   

 
Learn About It!  
 

Here are some tips for planning and writing your own                   
monologue: 
 

● Think of the character. 
In thinking of a character for a monologue, you do not                     
need to immediately identify the deeper details about him                 
or her. You can start by thinking of distinct nonverbal                   
elements such as facial expressions, gestures, and             
mannerisms that your character may possess. You may               

  13
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    



 
 
 

 
also think of an inspiration, like a favorite movie character or a person close to you. For                                 
example, if you would like to do a monologue of a mother, you may pattern your                               
character’s physical traits after that of your own mom. 
 

● Create a character profile. 
Now that you have set your character’s physical traits, you can start thinking of a                             
suitable character profile. This must include the following: 
○ Name (or nickname) of your character 
○ Age – Is the character a child, teenager, young adult, adult? 
○ Gender – Is the character male or female? Do they conform to any gender norm? 
○ Social status – what kind of upbringing ​did the character have? Does he or she have                               

a job or is he or she still studying? 
○ Attitudes – What kind of attitude does your character have? Is he or she kind or                               

greedy? Is he or she cool or temperamental? 
○ Others – This may include hobbies, likes and dislikes, and other important                       

information that may help in the character profile. 
 

● Write your script. 
○ Make sure that you introduce your character to the audience.  
○ Begin by giving a short line wherein the character speaks his or her mind. This must                               

either be addressed to the audience or delivered as an aside.  
○ Make the audience or reader familiar with the situation your character is in by taking                             

them on a journey of the character’s thoughts.  
○ Make sure that the message of your monologue is received by the audience.  
○ Do not leave the monologue hanging and full of confusion. Try to end it as smoothly                               

as possible. 
 

● Edit your draft. 
Do not forget to check for errors or add details that you think are relevant to your                                 
monologue. Do this until you feel that the monologue is up to your standards. 
 
You may use an outline to plan out the details of your monologue. Here is a sample

Read the excerpt below from James Joyce’s story, “Araby”. From the details, what can we say about what the narrator feels about the girl? 

...If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother into his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.

From the lines, we can easily infer that the young narrator is infatuated with Mangan’s sister, his neighbor. We can guess from the way he looked at her specially, how he devoted all his attention to her whenever he saw her, and what happened to him whenever their paths crossed. Just the phrase “my heart leaped” is enough clue that he deeply admires the girl, and you as a reader would know his feelings just by reading between the lines.

Read the passage and fill in the table with the appropriate details from the given passages.
PASSAGE 1:

North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.
The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.
When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ash pits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas.


Why was the priest considered a charitable person?
Who recently passed away as described by the narrator?

At the end of this lesson, you should be able to use appropriate modifiers.

Essential Question
How do modifiers affect cohesion in writing?
Report errors
	2	Learn about It!
A dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a pronoun. Therefore, it is a modifier that has nothing to describe or modify. 
Report errors
	3	Learn about It!
Correcting a Dangling Modifier
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be describing. 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must supply the missing modified word to complete the thought of the sentence. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the context of the sentence.

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground.

In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying the water jug. It may leave an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. One way of correcting the sentence is to leave the modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the pronoun I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, I saw my water jug fall on the ground.”

At the end of the lesson, you should be able to

identify foreshadowing in a text.


Essential Question
How can foreshadowing help readers make predictions and inferences more effectively?
Report errors"
english 9,Making Predictions,What Is Foreshadowing?,page_2,"Learn about It!
Foreshadowing is a literary device where a writer provides an early hint of what is to come later in the story. It is usually seen at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and helps the reader predict what is to happen next in a story. 
Report errors"
english 9,Making Predictions,What Is Foreshadowing?,page_3,"Learn about It!

Foreshadowing creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, which make the readers even more enticed to finish reading it.
 It also builds anticipation in the readers’ minds about what might happen next, thus adding more dramatic tension to a story.
 Foreshadowing also makes the reader search for possible reasons or symbolisms to the events unfolding in the story. 
For mystery fiction, foreshadowing is easier to spot, but sometimes, the writer gives false clues, or red herrings, to distract the readers.
 Foreshadowing can also make unusual events appear believable to the reader as the events are predicted, mentally preparing the readers for these twists.

In the opening paragraph of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher”, the underlined are the clues that could be considered as foreshadowing as they hint on the terrible and scary ending of the story which is  hinted in the title:
During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.

Write true if the statement is correct and false if it is wrong.

A writer who provides an early hint of what is to come later in the story is using foreshadowing.
The other word for foreshadowing is flashback.

Read some lines from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne below and look for foreshadowing details by underlining them.

With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude.
""There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,"" said Goodman Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, ""What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!""

Identifying Foreshadowing in a Text

 Look at the title of a text or a chapter title that can give a clue on what is going to happen later in the story.
 Look at words or phrases in character dialogues to hint at what may occur in the future. Some characters or narrations refer to possible future actions. 
A sudden change in the environment that the character observes and relates to another character can also give an inkling.
Ominous events or actions can also be considered as foreshadowing especially if they show a sudden change of movement or turn of events
A change in the setting and the atmosphere can also be predictive of what is to come. 
There can also be objects or scenic elements that suggest something happy, sad, dangerous, exciting, etc.

Read the excerpt below from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Note how the wife’s lines foreshadow Young Goodman Brown’s miserable end in the story because he did not listen to his wife and still went to the forest for an errand.

Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown.
""Dearest heart,"" whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear, ""prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year.""
