A discourse is a formal and often lengthy discussion of a topic, where concepts and insights are arranged in an organized and logical manner. It is often associated with speech, but it may also be written. It usually serves as a writer’s or a scholar’s analysis of a concept or theory proposed by another writer.

Analyzing a Discourse
Analyzing a discourse is usually contextual. The reader tries to consider several factors that may have influenced the writer to make certain claims. Those factors explain the author’s biases, philosophy, and educational and professional backgrounds, among others. Below are three of those factors.
Culture
The beliefs, customs, attitudes, language, and other things that define culture may influence the author’s perspective on several issues. Knowing about the culture the author belongs to may help the reader may understand his or her biases.
Social environment
The author’s physical surroundings and social relationships, as well as the culture of the time may have influenced his or her writing. For instance, during the early decades of the 20th century, most writers produced works that were classified as “modern” because of its distinct feature: stream of consciousness.
Experiences
Personal accounts or firsthand experience of events, though subjective, establish credibility and reliability of information presented in any discourse.
