The reader tries to consider several factors that may have influenced the writer to make certain claims. Those factors explain the author’s biases, philosophy, and educational and professional backgrounds, among others. Below are three of those factors.\\nCulture\\nThe beliefs, customs, attitudes, language, and other things that define culture may influence the author’s perspective on several issues. Knowing about the culture the author belongs to may help the reader may understand his or her biases.\\nSocial environment\\nThe author’s physical surroundings and social relationships, as well as the culture of the time may have influenced his or her writing. For instance, during the early decades of the 20th century, most writers produced works that were classified as “modern” because of its distinct feature: stream of consciousness.\\nExperiences\\nPersonal accounts or firsthand experience of events, though subjective, establish credibility and reliability of information presented in any discourse.\\nReport errors', '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - DEFINITION AND PURPOSES OF A DISCOURSE - PAGE_6###': '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - DEFINITION AND PURPOSES OF A DISCOURSE - PAGE_6###Keypoints\\nA discourse is a formal and often lengthy discussion of a topic, where concepts and insights are arranged in an organized and logical manner.

It points out what one should know about a topic or subject.\\nTo persuade – A discourse that aims to persuade tries to convince the readers that the proposed claim or solution is better than any other proposal.\\nTo entertain – A discourse that aims to amuse provides a source of entertainment for its readers.\\n\\nReport errors', '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - DEFINITION AND PURPOSES OF A DISCOURSE - STUDY GUIDE###': 'NO STUDY GUIDE', '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_1###': '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_1###Objective\\nAt the end of this lesson, you should be able to differentiate between the types of discourses.\\nReport errors', '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_2###': '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_2###Learn about It!\\nTypes of Discourse\\n1)  Argumentation\\nArgumentation is the act or process of making and presenting arguments. Arguments are a series of statements for or against an idea. \\nIn an argumentative discourse, the writer aims to persuade the audience or readers. He or she presents valid claims or counterclaims, each supported by evidence, to prove a point. In proving claims, the writer presents studies, experts’ opinions, and statistical data, among others. Moreover, an argumentative discourse should appeal to logic or reason instead of emotion.\\nReport errors', '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_3###': '###READING AND WRITING SKILLS - TEXT AS A CONNECTED DISCOURSE - TYPES OF DISCOURSE - PAGE_3###Learn about It!\\n2) Description\\nThis type of discourse is based on the main impression of the author about the topic or subject. Its purpose is to transmit that impression through concrete, colorful, and vivid language so that readers can fully imagine the topic or subject.\\nAn author’s impression is influenced by his or her prior knowledge, culture, environment, and experiences, among others.
