UNIT 21    
Cohesion in Writing 
In meditation, we try to connect ourselves to               
our innermost thoughts and the calming           
presence of our surroundings. Writing is the             
same. It needs the same balance and harmony               
among its sentences and paragraphs to           
connect the ideas of the writer and to convey                 
them to his or her audience. Cohesion in               
writing requires the smooth flow of words,             
phrases, and sentences in order for the             
readers to understand the ideas the writer wants to convey. In this unit, we will discuss                               
important concepts related to cohesion. 
 
 

 

Unit Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
● use appropriate modifiers;  
● use parallel structures; and 
● compose an informative essay.

Lesson 1: Misplaced Modifiers 
   

A ​modifier is a word or group of words that                   
describes some other words in the sentence. Take               
a look at this sentence: “The man found a golden                   
ticket.” In this example, the word ​golden describes               
the noun ​ticket​. Modifiers are sometimes           
misplaced in a sentence, and this may cause               
confusion. This lesson will help you learn how to spot misplaced modifiers and                         
correct them. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Think-Pair-Share 
 
With a partner, examine the sentence below. What can you and your partner say about the                               
sentence? Are the modifiers appropriately used? Revise the sentence to make it clear and                           
logical. Share your sentence in class. 
 

 

 
The sales agent sold the picture to the petite lady in the wooden frame.

Learn About It!  
 

 
There are instances in which sentences have modifiers that are                   
wrongly placed. This may cause problems in identifying what the                   
modifier describes. When a modifier is not correctly placed, it is                     
called a misplaced modifier. ​Misplaced modifiers happen when               
the modifier is not placed right next to the word it modifies.                       
Because of this, a sentence will sound awkward, ridiculous, and                   
illogical. 
 
Here is an example. 

 

The ​leather​ man’s sweater is missing. 

 
In this example, ​leather describes the word ​man​. The problem is                     
that there is no such thing as a man made of leather. Therefore,                         
the word ​leather is a misplaced modifier. To correct this sentence,                     
leather should be moved to a more sensible place such as before                       
the word ​sweater​, which will make the sentence more logical. The                     
correct sentence should be “The man’s leather sweater is                 
missing.”  
 

Here is another example. 
 

The ​crumpled​ student’s uniform was ironed this morning. 

 
The sentence in this example is quite confusing because it means that the student is                             
described as crumpled. To correct this sentence, the word ​crumpled must be placed beside                           
the word ​uniform​. Hence, the sentence will become “The student’s crumpled uniform was                         
ironed this morning.”

Here is another example. 
 

The ​torn​ child’s book lay on the table. 

 
In this example, can you identify the misplaced modifier? What is the correct placement of the                               
modifier? What is the correct sentence? 
 
 
Phrase and Clause Modifiers 
 
Phrase and clause modifiers may also be misplaced. Look at the examples below: 
 

Loaded with sauce and meatballs​, Lucy ate spaghetti. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that Lucy is covered in sauce and meatballs as she ate                                 
spaghetti. This is an illogical sentence and will confuse the readers. To correct this sentence,                             
move the phrase “loaded with sauce and meatballs” next to ​spaghetti​, which is the word it                               
should modify. The sentence will now become “Lucy ate spaghetti loaded with sauce and                           
meatballs.” 
 

Sheryl saw a kitten ​on the way to the airport​. 

 
In this example, the phrase “on the way to the airport” modifies the word ​kitten​. This may be                                   
interpreted as the kitten being the one going to the airport and Sheryl seeing it. To correct the                                   
sentence, the phrase should be placed next to ​Sheryl. This will transform the sentence to “On                               
the way to the airport, Sheryl saw a kitten.” 
 

We served a piece of chocolate brownie to our mother ​that is full of icing​. 

 
In this example, the sentence describes the mother as being covered with lots of icing as we                                 
give her a piece of chocolate brownie. To correct this sentence, move the clause next to                               
brownie​. The changed sentence will be, “We served a piece of chocolate brownie that is full of                                 
icing to our mother.”

The boy ate a cookie ​who has a mohawk​. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the cookie sports a mohawk hairstyle. The clause                             
must be connected to the noun it should modify, which is ​boy​. The sentence should be “The                                 
boy who has a mohawk ate a cookie.” 
 
 
Placement of Adverbs 
 
Take note that modifiers such as ​almost, nearly, only, just, ​slowly, and ​barely are often placed                               
incorrectly in sentences. Look at the following examples. 
 

My brother ​nearly​ swam for two hours. 

 
In this example, the sentence means that the speaker’s brother did not really swim but                             
contemplated doing so for two hours. The use of the modifier ​nearly in this sentence is                               
wrongly placed and should be moved next to a more logical modified word. The sentence                             
should be “My brother swam for nearly two hours” so that the sentence would mean that the                                 
speaker’s brother swam for less than two hours. 
 

The agent ​almost​ earned P25,000.00 this afternoon. 

 
In this example, the agent did not earn the amount of money. To change this sentence, the                                 
modifier ​almost should be moved next to a more logical modified word, making the sentence:                             
“The agent earned almost P25,000.00 this afternoon.” 
 

The trainees ate the lunch that they had brought ​slowly​. 

 
In this example, the trainees brought lunch slowly. To change this sentence, the modifier                           
slowly should be moved next to a more logical modified word in the sentence. The correct                               
sentence should be: “The trainees slowly ate the lunch that they had brought.”

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the misplaced modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. The salesman almost made P50,000.00 today. 
2. The activity scarcely took an hour to complete. 
3. The regional director only has five minutes to talk with the guest. 
4. When they opened the leather woman’s bag, they found the missing keys. 
5. The farmers were spraying their crops wearing protective masks. 

 
 

Write ​C if the modifier in the sentence is in the correct position and ​X if it is                                   
misplaced. 

 
_____1. We made sure we will have cake from the vanilla woman. 
_____2. Dana was nearly shopping for two hours. 
_____3. Trevor tried to catch his slippery toad. 
_____4. The light shone through the thin wrapping.

Lesson 2: Dangling Modifiers 
   

 
Not only can modifiers be         
misplaced but there are also         
times when the modified words         
cannot be found in the sentence.           
This lack of modified word(s)         
makes the modifier lose its         
connection to the sentence. Such modifiers are called               
dangling modifiers.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes                       
something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a                         
pronoun. Therefore, it is a ​modifier that has nothing to                   
describe​ ​or modify​.  
 
 
Correcting a Dangling Modifier 
 
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear                 
and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a                     
failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be                   
describing.  
 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must ​supply the                   
missing modified word to complete the thought of the                 
sentence​. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the                           
context of the sentence. 
 
Take a look at the following examples: 
 

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground. 

 
In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying ​water jug​. It may leave                                   
an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. To correct the sentence, leave the                               
modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the                                 
pronoun ​I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, ​I saw my                                 
water jug fall on the ground.”

When six years old, my father went to law school. 

 
In this example, the phrase “when six years old” looks as if it modifies the noun ​father​. This                                   
may mean that the speaker’s father went to law school when he was six years old. To correct                                   
this dangling modifier, insert the noun or pronoun within the dangling modifier to make it a                               
dependent clause. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be “When ​I was six years old, my                             
father went to law school.” 
 

After showing my ticket, the gate opened. 

 
In this example, the modifier gives an impression that the gate automatically opened when                           
the speaker showed the ticket. This makes the meaning of the sentence confusing. A modified                             
word should be inserted to make the sentence logical. The revised sentence should be “After ​I                               
showed my ticket to the marshal​, the gate opened.” 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 

 

 Check Your Understanding  
 

 
Underline the dangling modifier in each of the following sentences. 
 

1. Leaving quickly, her car lights were left on. 
2. While exercising, my shirt tore. 
3. Once filled with ink, you can write for hours before the pen runs dry. 
4. Standing on the runway, a plane will hit you. 
5. Having done the dishes and vacuumed the floors, her house looked decent again.

Lesson 3: Parallel Structure of Words and 
Phrases 

 
Aside from the correct placement of           
modifiers, a sentence should also have a             
balanced form. The use of parallel           
structure in your writing will help you             
achieve this balance. You will learn           
more about this structure in this lesson.

Learn About It!  
 

 
A ​parallel structure means that certain parts of a sentence                   
have the same form and function. It allows the writer a smooth                       
and effective flow of his or her thoughts, making the sentences                     
grammatically correct. 
 
 
Parallel Structure Guidelines 
 
To make sure that the words and phrases in your sentences                     
have parallel structure, take note of the following guidelines: 
 
1. Words or phrases joined by coordinating conjunctions should                 
have the same structure. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and doesn’t smell very good. 
 
Parallel structure: The homeless dog is lonely, skinny, and smelly.     

 
In this example, ​lonely​ and ​skinny​ are both adjectives. The last word in the series should thus 
have the same structure as the first two in the series. 
 

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We enjoy writing, biking, and to cook. 
 
Parallel structure: We enjoy writing, biking, and cooking. 

 
In this example, ​writing​ and ​biking​ are both gerunds. The last word in the series should thus 
also be a gerund.

Faulty parallel structure:​ ​We like to write, to swim, and doing the dishes. 
 
Parallel structure: We like to write, to swim, and to do the dishes. 
                                 We like to write, swim, and do the dishes. 

 
In this example, the series contains infinitives (to + verb). To make the elements parallel, the                               
series may have all verbs as infinitives or have the first verb in the series as an infinitive                                   
followed by the base form of the verb in the next verbs in the series. 
 
 
2. Use parallel structures with phrases joined by linking verbs or be verbs. 
 

Faulty parallel structure​: ​To see is believing. 
 
Parallel structure: To see is to believe. 
                                 Seeing is believing. 

 
In this example, the first element should be completed by the second element. In order for                               
this to be parallel, the second element should have the same structure as the first element                               
and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: To succeed is making the most out of every opportunity. 
 
Parallel structure: To succeed is to make the most out of every opportunity. 
                                 Succeeding is making the most out of every opportunity. 

 
In this example, the first element, which is “To succeed,” is completed by the second element,                               
which is “making the most out of every opportunity.” To make this parallel, the second                             
element should have the same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 
 
Parallel structure: Being wealthy is not the same thing as being happy. 
                                 To be wealthy is not the same thing as to be happy. 

  15

In this example, the first element, which is “Being wealthy,” is completed by the second                             
element, which is “to be happy.” To make this parallel, the second element should have the                               
same structure as the first element and vice versa. 
 
 
3. Elements joined by correlative conjunctions should also follow similar structure. Whatever                       
the structure of the first element should also be the structure of the element that follows it. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor go to church. 
 
Parallel structure: Axel was neither attending band practice nor going to church.   

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​neither-nor​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​neither​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​nor. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and it is educational. 
 
Parallel structure: The toy I bought is both enjoyable and educational.     

 
In this example, the second element does not have the same structure as the first element. In                                 
order for the sentence to be parallel, the second element should follow the structure of the                               
first element. 
 

Faulty parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or is she a member. 
 
Parallel structure: Roxanne is either an officer or a member.     

 
In this example, the sentence used the correlative conjunction ​either-or​. The structure of the                           
first phrase after ​either​ should also be the structure of the phrase that follows ​or.

Lesson 4: Parallel Structure of Clauses 
   

 
In writing, the use of parallel           
structure is essential in order to           
achieve balance and clarity of         
ideas. In the previous lesson, we           
learned that some parts or         
elements of a sentence—words       
and phrases—that are similar in function should also be                 
similar in terms of structure. In this lesson, we will be dealing                       
with parallel structure of clauses.   

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Group Activity 
 
Form a group of four. Read and examine the sentence below. What does your group think 
about the sentence? Revise the sentence to make the clauses parallel.   

 

 
My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my words. 

Revised sentence: 

 
 
Each member of the group should create a sentence about herself or himself. The sentence 
should be similar to the revised sentence in terms of structure. Share your sentences in class.

Learn About It!  
 

 
When a sentence has more than one clause, its clauses should                     
also have parallel structure. A change in the voice of verbs                     
makes its parallelism faulty. 
 
The parallel structure of clauses follows the same rules as the                     
parallel structure of words and phrases. Here are some                 
examples: 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​The people gossiped about who she was and her purpose of                           
attending the party. 
 
Parallel structure: The people gossiped about ​who she was​ and ​why she attended the party​. 

 
In this example, the second element “her purpose of attending the party” does not have the                               
same structure as the first element “who she was.” In order for the sentence to be parallel, the                                   
second element should follow the structure of the first element. In this case, “her purpose of                               
attending the party” should be changed to “why she attended the party.” 
 

Faulty parallel structure: ​Please give us a tally of scores before the game ends or the referee                                 
announces the winner. 
 
Parallel structure: Please give us a tally of scores ​before the game ends or ​when the referee                                 
announces the winner​. 

 
In this example, the second element “the referee announces the winner” does not have the                             
same structure as the first element “before the game ends.” In order for the sentence to be                                 
parallel, “the referee announces the winner” should be changed to “when the referee                         
announces the winner.”

Faulty parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on what I did or my                               
words. 
 
Parallel structure: My friends never judged my character based on ​what I did​ or ​what I said​. 

 
In this example, the second element “my words” does not have the same structure as the first                                 
element “what I did.” To make the sentence parallel, “my words” should be changed to “what I                                 
said.” 
 
In all of the examples given, the second element should follow the structure of the first                               
element. In this case, the structure should be rewritten in clause form.
