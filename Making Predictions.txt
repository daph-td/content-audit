UNIT 21    

Making Predictions 
 
When we read a mystery novel, we tend to make                   
predictions, guessing what is going to happen next.               
In this way, the writer of the story becomes                 
successful in making us active readers as we               
wonder and discover how the story unfolds. 

In this unit, we will learn about the difference                 
between making inferences and making predictions,           
identifying foreshadowing, and analyzing the use of             
foreshadowing in a text.  

 
 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● distinguish making inferences from making predictions;  
● identify foreshadowing in a text; and 
● analyze the information contained in the material read.

Lesson 1: Making Inferences vs. Making 
Predictions 

   
Sometimes, the stories we read         
do not include all the details we             
need to know, and this is what             
makes reading interesting and       
challenging for us.  

This is also a reason why young             
readers need two of the most essential reading skills, making                   
inferences and making predictions, to get the most out of reading                     
literature. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Review: Making Predictions and Inferences 
 
Look at the given pictures. Write a 
short paragraph about them and 
what you think might happen 
next. 

Share your inferences and 
predictions with a partner.

Guide questions: 

● Were your predictions similar to that of your partner? Why or why not? 
● What were some of the things you considered when you wrote your predictions and 

inferences? Why? 

 
 

Learn About It!  
 

When ​making an inference, you form an opinion or reach a                     
conclusion based on known facts evident in the text. You use                     
the information, along with what you already know, to figure                   
out something about the text that the author did not tell you.  

 
You can infer the traits of a             
character, the meaning of the         
character’s words, or the       
feelings of the character in a particular event. If the author                     
does not explicitly tell you about these details, you have to                     
read between the lines​ or make inferences. 
 
Sometimes, your inferences will not be confirmed. Further               
details along the story will however strengthen or weaken the                   
validity of your guesses. 

 
On the other hand, you ​make predictions ​about what                 
might happen or will happen in the future, based on                   
facts, observations, personal experiences, or scientific           
reasons that you learned previously.  
 
You can predict what is going to happen to the character                     
at the end of the story, given the details about his or her                         
situation, character traits, or relationships with other             
characters.

However, predictions are not 100 percent certain. You will know whether your prediction is                           
correct as you read further. 
 
In short, the difference between the two reading skills is the ​time element​. Inferences are not                               
usually employed when talking about future events, but both skills rely on a combination of                             
what you know already and what you encountered in the text. 
 
Read the excerpt below from James Joyce’s story “Araby.” 
 
From the details, what can we say about what the narrator feels about the girl?  
 

...If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him                                   
safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother into his                                 
tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see                                 
whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked                                 
up to Mangan’s steps resignedly.  
 
She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her                               
brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her                                 
dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side. 
 
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was                                 
pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out                                       
on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept                                     
her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways                                   
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her.  
 
This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual                               
words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood. 

 
From the lines, we can easily infer that the young narrator is infatuated with Mangan’s sister,                               
his neighbor. We can guess from the way he looked at her specially, how he devoted all his                                   
attention to her whenever he saw her, and what happened to him whenever their paths                             
crossed.

Just the phrase “my heart leaped” is enough clue that he deeply admires the girl, and you as a                                     
reader would know his feelings just by reading between the lines. 
 

Read another section from the story below: 

At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I                                       
did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I                                   
answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go. 
 
“And why can’t you?” I asked. 
 
While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. 
 
She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her                                   
brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She                                   
held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me.  
 
The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her                                   
hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of                                     
her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease. 
 
“It’s well for you,” she said. 
 
“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.” 

 
Do you think the narrator will be able to keep his promise? Do you think she will love him back                                       
by fulfilling this promise? These are questions that require you to make predictions because                           
they ask you to guess what will happen next.  
 
Read further, find clues, and make further predictions: 
 

When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat                                     
staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the

room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high cold                               
empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front                               
window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me                           
weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over                           
at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing                                 
but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at                           
the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress. 
 
When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old                                 
garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected used stamps for some pious                       
purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table.  
 
The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer                               
stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any longer, but it was after eight o’clock                                   
and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I                                           
began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said: 
 
“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.” 
 
At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself                                   
and heard the hall stand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could                                 
interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the                                 
money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten. 
 
“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said. 
 
I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically: 
 
“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late enough as it is.” 
 
My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying:                                   
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked me where I was going and, when I                                       
had told him a second time he asked me did I know The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed.                                   
When I left the kitchen, he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.

Because it was already late when his uncle gave him money to go to the bazaar, one will most                                     
likely predict that he will not make it to the bazaar, and consequently, he will not be able to                                     
buy something for the girl.  

This obstacle may help one guess that the boy has little chance to fulfill his promise.

A. Read the passage and fill in the table with the appropriate details from the given                             
passages. 

 

Below are excerpts from the story “Araby”: 
PASSAGE 1​: 

(1) North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the                             
Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys                         
stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The                           
other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one                           
another with brown imperturbable faces. 
 

(2) The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air,                             
musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room

behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few                             
paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by                         
Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last                           
best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a                           
central apple-tree and a few straggling           
bushes under one of which I found the               
late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had           
been a very charitable priest; in his will               
he had left all his money to institutions               
and the furniture of his house to his               
sister. 
 

(3) When the short days of winter came             
dusk fell before we had well eaten our               
dinners. When we met in the street the               
houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of                           
ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble                         
lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts                             
echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark                             
muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes                           
from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours                           
arose from the ash pits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed                           
and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we                         
returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. 

 

PASSAGE 2:  

(1) I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the                               
station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled                           
to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a                                 
deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly.                           
It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river.  
 

(2) At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the

porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I                             
remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an                               
improvised wooden platform. I passed out onto the road and saw by the lighted                           
dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building                                     
which displayed the magical name. 
 

(3) I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be                           
closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a                         
weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a                               
gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in                               
darkness.  
 

(4) I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked                             
into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls                             
which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Café Chantant were                           
written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to                             
the fall of the coins.

Learn About It!  
 

Foreshadowing ​is a literary device in which a writer provides                   
an early hint of what is to come later in the story. It is usually                             
seen at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and helps the                         
reader predict future events in a story.  

Foreshadowing creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story,                 
which make the readers even more enticed to finish reading it.                     
It is one of the elements that make the reader look forward to                         
the next events that will unfold in the story. It also builds                       
anticipation in the readers’ minds about what might happen                 
next, thus adding more dramatic tension to a narrative.  

Foreshadowing also makes the reader search for possible               
reasons or symbolisms ​in the events unfolding in the story. For                     
mystery fiction, foreshadowing is easier to spot, but               
sometimes, the writer gives false clues, or red herrings, to                   
distract the readers.  

Foreshadowing can also make unusual events appear believable to the reader as the events                           
are predicted, mentally preparing the readers for these twists. 

For instance, in the opening paragraph of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,”                                 
the underlined words are the clues that could be considered as foreshadowing as they hint on                               
the terrible and scary ending of the story, which is hinted at in the title: 

During the whole of a ​dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the                                   
clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback,                           
through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of                               
the evening drew on, within view of the ​melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it                                 
was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, ​a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my                             
spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable,                           
because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural                         
images of the desolate or terrible.

I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape                           
features of the domain--upon the ​bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows​--upon a                       
few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks               
of ​decayed trees​--with an utter depression of             
soul which I can compare to no earthly               
sensation more properly than to the           
after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the           
bitter lapse into everyday life--​the hideous           
dropping off of the veil. ​There was an iciness, a                   
sinking, a sickening of the heart--an           
unredeemed dreariness of thought which no           
goading of the imagination could torture into             
aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to                 
think--what was it that so unnerved me in the                 
contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a                 
mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me                             
as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while,                             
beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power                           
of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our                             
depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of                             
the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to                               
annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my                           
horse to the precipitous brink of a ​black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the                                   
dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the                         
remodelled and inverted images of the ​grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the                           
vacant and eye-like windows. 

 
Notice that the narrator describes an eerie and unexplainable feeling upon seeing the house,                           
making the reader feel something mysterious about it.  

The description of the bizarre atmosphere of the decaying old house, which also acts as a                               
symbol, gives away a hint of the fall of the house of the Usher later on.

B. Read some lines from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne below                     

and look for foreshadowing details by underlining them.  
C.  

(1) With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself justified in                         
making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had taken a dreary road,                           
darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let                             
the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as                         
lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller                               
knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs                           
overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen                           
multitude. 
 

(2) "There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree," said Goodman Brown to                         
himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, "What if the devil                           
himself should be at my very elbow!" 
 

(3) His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, looking forward                             
again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire, seated at the foot of                                 
an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's approach and walked onward side by                           
side with him. 
 

(4) "You are late, Goodman Brown," said he. "The clock of the Old South was striking                             
as I came through Boston, and that is full.” 
 

(5) "Faith kept me back a while," replied the young man, with a tremor in his voice,                               
caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though not wholly                     
unexpected. 
 

(6) It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it where these two                                   
were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, the second traveller was about                         
fifty years old, apparently in the same rank of life as Goodman Brown, and                           
bearing a considerable resemblance to him, though perhaps more in expression                     
than features.  
 

(7) Still they might have been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder

person was as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had an                                 
indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not have felt                           
abashed at the governor's dinner table or in King William's court, were it possible                           
that his affairs should call him thither.  
 

(8) But the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff,                               
which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might                             
almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent. This, of course, must                               
have been an ocular deception, assisted by the uncertain light.

role in this famous idea of Anton Chekhov.

Lesson 3: Analyzing a Foreshadowing 
   

Sometimes, writers put clues in a text to give readers an                     
inkling of what is to happen next in a story. If we are keen                           
enough, we can use these clues to our advantage and form                     
our own predictions; thus, we can guess the ending even if                     
we have not reached that part yet. However, detecting                 
these clues entails knowing how to spot them in the text. 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Brainstorming: Foreshadowing Bank 
 
Brainstorm on possible foreshadowing or scenes that you can use as authors that can lead to 
the given events. An example has been given to guide your brainstorming. 

Share these ideas in a groups of three to four. 

Themes  Foreshadowing/Scenes 
a budding romance  1. A girl walking while carrying a ton of books, and a boy 

running toward her. 
a murder that is about to 

happen 
2.  

sadness/loneliness  3.  
a disaster in the kitchen  4.  
an underdog winning a 

competition 
5.  

 
Guide Questions: 
 

● What styles in writing were commonly used in the group? What was the most 
interesting one? Why did you think that?

Learn About It!  
 

There are various ways to detect foreshadowing in a story.  

Initially, you can ​look at the title of a text or a chapter title                           
that can give a clue on what is going to happen later on in the                             
story.  

You can also ​look at words or phrases in character                   
dialogues to hint at what may occur in the future. Some                     
characters or narrations refer to possible future actions.  

A sudden change in the environment that the character                 
observes and relates to another character can also give an                   
inkling. 

Ominous events or actions​ can also be considered as foreshadowing especially if they show 
a sudden change of movement or turn of events;  some of these can be superstitious and 
depend on the culture of origin of the text, like the Filipinos’ belief in the bad luck associated 
with black cats.  

A ​change in the setting and the atmosphere​ can also be predictive of what is to come like a 
sudden outpour of rain.  

There can also be ​objects or scenic elements​ that suggest something happy, sad, dangerous, 
exciting, and the like. 

Example​: 

Read the excerpt below from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  

Note how the wife’s lines foreshadow Young Goodman Brown’s miserable end in the story                           
because he did not listen to his wife and still went to the forest for an errand. 

Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his                               
head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And                               
Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the

wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown. 

"Dearest heart," whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear,                               
"prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone                               
woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself                           
sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year."

B. Read the following excerpt from “The Fall of the House of Usher.” Answer the                           
questions by citing passages from the given text. 

 

(1) I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of                         
looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression.                       
There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my                           
superstition--for why should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the                       
increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments                           
having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I                                 
again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in                                 
my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to                             
show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me.   
 

(2) I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole                             
mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their                       
immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven,                       
but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent                               
tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and                   
leaden-hued.  
 

(3) Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more                           
narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of                             
an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi                       
overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.                         
Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the                         
masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still                           
perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.   
 

(4) In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work                             

  21

which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from                           
the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however,                         
the fabric gave little token of instability.   
 

(5) Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely                       
perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made                         
its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters                                 
of the tarn. 

 
1. What paragraph describes the physical situation of the house? Cite a phrase that                         

best shows this.  
2. What paragraph describes the narrator’s sentiments about the house? Explain                   

why.  
3. What can you infer on the narrator’s intent in this text?  
4. What can you predict will be the dialogue of the narrator?

Making Predictions 
When making an inference, you form an opinion or reach a conclusion based on 
known facts or evidence in the text, along with what you already know, to figure out 
something about the text that the author did not tell you. 

When making predictions, you say something about what might happen or will happen 
in the future based on some fact, observation, experience, or scientific reason that you 
learned previously. 

Foreshadowing  a literary device in which a writer 
provides an early hint of what is to 
come later on in the story 

The following are some details that could 
hint on a foreshadowing 

1. the title of a text or a chapter title 

2. character dialogues 

3. characters or narrations that refer 
to possible future actions 

4. a sudden change in the 
environment that the character 
observes and relates to another 
character 

5. a sudden change of movement or 
turn of events 

6. change in the setting and the 
atmosphere

UNIT 21    

Making Predictions 
 
When we read a mystery novel, we tend to make                   
predictions, guessing what is going to happen next.               
In this way, the writer of the story becomes                 
successful in making us active readers as we               
wonder and discover how the story unfolds. 

In this unit, we will learn about the difference                 
between making inferences and making predictions,           
identifying foreshadowing, and analyzing the use of             
foreshadowing in a text.  

 
 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● distinguish making inferences from making predictions;  
● identify foreshadowing in a text; and 
● analyze the information contained in the material read.

Lesson 1: Making Inferences vs. Making 
Predictions 

   
Sometimes, the stories we read         
do not include all the details we             
need to know, and this is what             
makes reading interesting and       
challenging for us.  

This is also a reason why young             
readers need two of the most essential reading skills, making                   
inferences and making predictions, to get the most out of reading                     
literature. 

 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Review: Making Predictions and Inferences 
 
Look at the given pictures. Write a 
short paragraph about them and 
what you think might happen 
next. 

Share your inferences and 
predictions with a partner.

Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    
 
 
 
 
 



 
 
 

 
Guide questions: 

● Were your predictions similar to that of your partner? Why or why not? 
● What were some of the things you considered when you wrote your predictions and 

inferences? Why? 

 
 

Learn About It!  
 

When ​making an inference, you form an opinion or reach a                     
conclusion based on known facts evident in the text. You use                     
the information, along with what you already know, to figure                   
out something about the text that the author did not tell you.  

 
You can infer the traits of a             
character, the meaning of the         
character’s words, or the       
feelings of the character in a particular event. If the author                     
does not explicitly tell you about these details, you have to                     
read between the lines​ or make inferences. 
 
Sometimes, your inferences will not be confirmed. Further               
details along the story will however strengthen or weaken the                   
validity of your guesses. 

 
On the other hand, you ​make predictions ​about what                 
might happen or will happen in the future, based on                   
facts, observations, personal experiences, or scientific           
reasons that you learned previously.  
 
You can predict what is going to happen to the character                     
at the end of the story, given the details about his or her                         
situation, character traits, or relationships with other             
characters.

However, predictions are not 100 percent certain. You will know whether your prediction is                           
correct as you read further. 
 
In short, the difference between the two reading skills is the ​time element​. Inferences are not                               
usually employed when talking about future events, but both skills rely on a combination of                             
what you know already and what you encountered in the text. 
 
Read the excerpt below from James Joyce’s story “Araby.” 
 
From the details, what can we say about what the narrator feels about the girl?  
 

...If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him                                   
safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother into his                                 
tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see                                 
whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked                                 
up to Mangan’s steps resignedly.  
 
She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her                               
brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her                                 
dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side. 
 
Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was                                 
pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out                                       
on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept                                     
her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways                                   
diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her.  
 
This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual                               
words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood. 

 
From the lines, we can easily infer that the young narrator is infatuated with Mangan’s sister,                               
his neighbor. We can guess from the way he looked at her specially, how he devoted all his                                   
attention to her whenever he saw her, and what happened to him whenever their paths                             
crossed.

Just the phrase “my heart leaped” is enough clue that he deeply admires the girl, and you as a                                     
reader would know his feelings just by reading between the lines.

At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I                                       
did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I                                   
answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go. 
 
“And why can’t you?” I asked. 
 
While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. 
 
She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her                                   
brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She                                   
held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me.  
 
The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her                                   
hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of                                     
her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease. 
 
“It’s well for you,” she said. 
 
“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.” 

 
Do you think the narrator will be able to keep his promise? Do you think she will love him back                                       
by fulfilling this promise? These are questions that require you to make predictions because                           
they ask you to guess what will happen next.

When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat                                     
staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the

room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house. The high cold                               
empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front                               
window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me                           
weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over                           
at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing                                 
but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at                           
the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress. 
 
When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old                                 
garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected used stamps for some pious                       
purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table.  
 
The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer                               
stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any longer, but it was after eight o’clock                                   
and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I                                           
began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said: 
 
“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.” 
 
At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the hall door. I heard him talking to himself                                   
and heard the hall stand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could                                 
interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the                                 
money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten. 
 
“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said. 
 
I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically: 
 
“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late enough as it is.” 
 
My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying:                                   
“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked me where I was going and, when I                                       
had told him a second time he asked me did I know The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed.                                   
When I left the kitchen, he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.

Because it was already late when his uncle gave him money to go to the bazaar, one will most                                     
likely predict that he will not make it to the bazaar, and consequently, he will not be able to                                     
buy something for the girl.  

This obstacle may help one guess that the boy has little chance to fulfill his promise.

A. Read the passage and fill in the table with the appropriate details from the given                             
passages. 

 

Below are excerpts from the story “Araby”: 
PASSAGE 1​: 

(1) North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the                             
Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys                         
stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The                           
other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one                           
another with brown imperturbable faces. 
 

(2) The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air,                             
musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room

behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few                             
paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by                         
Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last                           
best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a                           
central apple-tree and a few straggling           
bushes under one of which I found the               
late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had           
been a very charitable priest; in his will               
he had left all his money to institutions               
and the furniture of his house to his               
sister. 
 

(3) When the short days of winter came             
dusk fell before we had well eaten our               
dinners. When we met in the street the               
houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of                           
ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble                         
lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts                             
echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark                             
muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes                           
from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours                           
arose from the ash pits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed                           
and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we                         
returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. 

 

PASSAGE 2:  

(1) I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the                               
station. The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled                           
to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a                                 
deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly.                           
It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river.  
 

(2) At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the

porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I                             
remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an                               
improvised wooden platform. I passed out onto the road and saw by the lighted                           
dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building                                     
which displayed the magical name. 
 

(3) I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be                           
closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a                         
weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a                               
gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in                               
darkness.  
 

(4) I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked                             
into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls                             
which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Café Chantant were                           
written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver. I listened to                             
the fall of the coins.

Learn About It!  
 

Foreshadowing ​is a literary device in which a writer provides                   
an early hint of what is to come later in the story. It is usually                             
seen at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and helps the                         
reader predict future events in a story.  

Foreshadowing creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story,                 
which make the readers even more enticed to finish reading it.                     
It is one of the elements that make the reader look forward to                         
the next events that will unfold in the story. It also builds                       
anticipation in the readers’ minds about what might happen                 
next, thus adding more dramatic tension to a narrative.  

Foreshadowing also makes the reader search for possible               
reasons or symbolisms ​in the events unfolding in the story. For                     
mystery fiction, foreshadowing is easier to spot, but               
sometimes, the writer gives false clues, or red herrings, to                   
distract the readers.  

Foreshadowing can also make unusual events appear believable to the reader as the events                           
are predicted, mentally preparing the readers for these twists. 

For instance, in the opening paragraph of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,”                                 
the underlined words are the clues that could be considered as foreshadowing as they hint on                               
the terrible and scary ending of the story, which is hinted at in the title: 

During the whole of a ​dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the                                   
clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback,                           
through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of                               
the evening drew on, within view of the ​melancholy House of Usher. I know not how it                                 
was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, ​a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my                             
spirit. I say insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable,                           
because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural                         
images of the desolate or terrible.

I looked upon the scene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape                           
features of the domain--upon the ​bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows​--upon a                       
few rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks               
of ​decayed trees​--with an utter depression of             
soul which I can compare to no earthly               
sensation more properly than to the           
after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the           
bitter lapse into everyday life--​the hideous           
dropping off of the veil. ​There was an iciness, a                   
sinking, a sickening of the heart--an           
unredeemed dreariness of thought which no           
goading of the imagination could torture into             
aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to                 
think--what was it that so unnerved me in the                 
contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a                 
mystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me                             
as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while,                             
beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power                           
of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our                             
depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of                             
the scene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to                               
annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my                           
horse to the precipitous brink of a ​black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the                                   
dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder even more thrilling than before--upon the                         
remodelled and inverted images of the ​grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the                           
vacant and eye-like windows. 

 
Notice that the narrator describes an eerie and unexplainable feeling upon seeing the house,                           
making the reader feel something mysterious about it.  

The description of the bizarre atmosphere of the decaying old house, which also acts as a                               
symbol, gives away a hint of the fall of the house of the Usher later on.

B. Read some lines from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne below                     

and look for foreshadowing details by underlining them.  
C.  

(1) With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself justified in                         
making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had taken a dreary road,                           
darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let                             
the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as                         
lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller                               
knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs                           
overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen                           
multitude. 
 

(2) "There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree," said Goodman Brown to                         
himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, "What if the devil                           
himself should be at my very elbow!" 
 

(3) His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, looking forward                             
again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire, seated at the foot of                                 
an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's approach and walked onward side by                           
side with him. 
 

(4) "You are late, Goodman Brown," said he. "The clock of the Old South was striking                             
as I came through Boston, and that is full.” 
 

(5) "Faith kept me back a while," replied the young man, with a tremor in his voice,                               
caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though not wholly                     
unexpected. 
 

(6) It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it where these two                                   
were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, the second traveller was about                         
fifty years old, apparently in the same rank of life as Goodman Brown, and                           
bearing a considerable resemblance to him, though perhaps more in expression                     
than features.  
 

(7) Still they might have been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder

person was as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had an                                 
indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not have felt                           
abashed at the governor's dinner table or in King William's court, were it possible                           
that his affairs should call him thither.  
 

(8) But the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff,                               
which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might                             
almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent. This, of course, must                               
have been an ocular deception, assisted by the uncertain light. 

 
 

D. Research on the phrase “like Chekhov’s gun.” ​Explain how foreshadowing plays a                       
role in this famous idea of Anton Chekhov.

Lesson 3: Analyzing a Foreshadowing 
   

Sometimes, writers put clues in a text to give readers an                     
inkling of what is to happen next in a story. If we are keen                           
enough, we can use these clues to our advantage and form                     
our own predictions; thus, we can guess the ending even if                     
we have not reached that part yet. However, detecting                 
these clues entails knowing how to spot them in the text.

Learn About It!  
 

There are various ways to detect foreshadowing in a story.  

Initially, you can ​look at the title of a text or a chapter title                           
that can give a clue on what is going to happen later on in the                             
story.  

You can also ​look at words or phrases in character                   
dialogues to hint at what may occur in the future. Some                     
characters or narrations refer to possible future actions.  

A sudden change in the environment that the character                 
observes and relates to another character can also give an                   
inkling. 

Ominous events or actions​ can also be considered as foreshadowing especially if they show 
a sudden change of movement or turn of events;  some of these can be superstitious and 
depend on the culture of origin of the text, like the Filipinos’ belief in the bad luck associated 
with black cats.  

A ​change in the setting and the atmosphere​ can also be predictive of what is to come like a 
sudden outpour of rain.  

There can also be ​objects or scenic elements​ that suggest something happy, sad, dangerous, 
exciting, and the like. 

Example​: 

Read the excerpt below from “Young Goodman Brown” by Nathaniel Hawthorne.  

Note how the wife’s lines foreshadow Young Goodman Brown’s miserable end in the story                           
because he did not listen to his wife and still went to the forest for an errand. 

Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his                               
head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And                               
Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the

wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown. 

"Dearest heart," whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear,                               
"prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone                               
woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself                           
sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year."

B. Read the following excerpt from “The Fall of the House of Usher.” Answer the                           
questions by citing passages from the given text. 

 

(1) I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment--that of                         
looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the first singular impression.                       
There can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my                           
superstition--for why should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate the                       
increase itself. Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments                           
having terror as a basis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I                                 
again uplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in                                 
my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to                             
show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me.   
 

(2) I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole                             
mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their                       
immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven,                       
but which had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall, and the silent                               
tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and                   
leaden-hued.  
 

(3) Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I scanned more                           
narrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed to be that of                             
an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been great. Minute fungi                       
overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves.                         
Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the                         
masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still                           
perfect adaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual stones.   
 

(4) In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work

which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from                           
the breath of the external air. Beyond this indication of extensive decay, however,                         
the fabric gave little token of instability.   
 

(5) Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely                       
perceptible fissure, which, extending from the roof of the building in front, made                         
its way down the wall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters                                 
of the tarn. 

 
1. What paragraph describes the physical situation of the house? Cite a phrase that                         

best shows this.  
2. What paragraph describes the narrator’s sentiments about the house? Explain                   

why.  
3. What can you infer on the narrator’s intent in this text?  
4. What can you predict will be the dialogue of the narrator?

Wrap Up 
 

Making Predictions 
When making an inference, you form an opinion or reach a conclusion based on 
known facts or evidence in the text, along with what you already know, to figure out 
something about the text that the author did not tell you. 

When making predictions, you say something about what might happen or will happen 
in the future based on some fact, observation, experience, or scientific reason that you 
learned previously. 

Foreshadowing  a literary device in which a writer 
provides an early hint of what is to 
come later on in the story 

The following are some details that could 
hint on a foreshadowing 

1. the title of a text or a chapter title 

2. character dialogues 

3. characters or narrations that refer 
to possible future actions 

4. a sudden change in the 
environment that the character 
observes and relates to another 
character 

5. a sudden change of movement or 
turn of events 

6. change in the setting and the 
atmosphere 

7. objects or scenes that suggest 
something happy, sad, dangerous, 
exciting, and many others

	1	Objective
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to use appropriate modifiers.

Essential Question
How do modifiers affect cohesion in writing?
Report errors
	2	Learn about It!
A dangling modifier is a word or group of words that describes something that is missing in a sentence, such as a noun or a pronoun. Therefore, it is a modifier that has nothing to describe or modify. 
Report errors
	3	Learn about It!
Correcting a Dangling Modifier
Dangling modifiers make the meaning of a sentence unclear and sometimes illogical. This type of error occurs because of a failure to indicate the word that the modifier should be describing. 
To correct a dangling modifier, the writer must supply the missing modified word to complete the thought of the sentence. Take note that the supplied modified word(s) should also be appropriate for the context of the sentence.
Report errors
	4	Example

Climbing a tree, my water jug fell on the ground.

In this example, the phrase “climbing a tree” seems like it is modifying the water jug. It may leave an impression that the water jug was the one climbing. One way of correcting the sentence is to leave the modifier as is and insert the actual modified word after the modifier. In this case, insert the pronoun I after the phrase modifier. The corrected sentence is now “Climbing a tree, I saw my water jug fall on the ground.”

	5	Check Your Understanding
Underline the dangling modifier in each of the following sentences.

Leaving quickly, her car lights were left on.
While exercising, my shirt tore.

Analyze the following sentences and revise them to correct the dangling modifiers.

Reading the magazine, an article on the latest gadgets caught my eye. 
When just five years old, an old lady saved my life.

Use the following modifiers to make a complete sentence. Follow the rules on avoiding dangling modifiers.
