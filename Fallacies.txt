UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

 Check Your Understanding  
 

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses. 
5. We won’t be at peace until there is a single American in this country.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

Learn About It!  
 

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.”

the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.”

This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to

because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical.

the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not?

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus

If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses. 
5. We won’t be at peace until there is a single American in this country.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

Learn About It!  
 

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know.

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses. 
5. We won’t be at peace until there is a single American in this country.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

With a partner, discuss why you think students follow the school rules below. 
 

1. wearing a school ID on campus 
2. not using cell phones in class 
3. not eating in classrooms 
4. having the prescribed hairstyle for girls and boys 
5. wearing the school uniform

Learn About It!  
 

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man.

Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

But here I am to speak what I do know.

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples:

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept

Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too

condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself.

Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not?

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself.

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest—

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus

And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know.

Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses. 
5. We won’t be at peace until there is a single American in this country.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself.

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.”

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the

so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion

engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not?

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not?

When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar by William                 
Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know.

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus

And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man.

But here I am to speak what I do know.

Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

UNIT 19    
Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate. 
 

 
Learn About It!  
 

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

 Check Your Understanding  
 

Identify whether the statement contains a formal fallacy (F) or an informal fallacy (I). 
 

1. The job applicant does not smile much and has no sense of fashion. We should not hire                                 
her. 

2. Cora told police that a woman with a tattoo stole her phone. Jessa has a tattoo.                               
Therefore, Cora told police that Jessa stole her phone. 

3. We will never progress as a nation if we allow all Chinese to remain in the Philippines. 
4. Majority of the masses support the president. Therefore, all those who support the                         

president are part of the masses. 
5. We won’t be at peace until there is a single American in this country.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer. 
 
 

 
Warm-up!

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums. 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    15 



 
 
 

 

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!

2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.

There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

The following are common fallacies of logos and their examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Circular reasoning  Goes back to the original 
statement and does not 
provide fresh and meaningful 
justification 

“If bringing cell phones in class 
was not prohibited, then it 
would not have been 
prohibited by the Discipline 
Office.” 

False dilemma  Presents only two options to 
choose from 

“Whoever does not vote for 
me in the election is either a 
loyalist or a terrorist.” 

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in 
class, many of our female 
students will become 
pregnant next year.” 

Questionable cause  Cause is not directly linked to 
the effect 

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really 
be excellent as we saw many 
visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between 
the premise and the 
conclusion 

UP is the best school for 
engineering since many of its 
engineering students pass the 
board exam.

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself.

Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples: 
 
 
 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    11 



 
 
 

 
 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious; 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    12 



 
 
 

 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments.

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.

Fallacies 
 
We all want to be heard. Part of being who we                     
are depends on having opportunities to express             
our thoughts and feelings, and sometimes,           
having the need to be believed in. We try to                   
justify our intentions and convince others to             
believe in us. However, we often find ourselves               
falling short of getting them on our side. Why?                 
Because we use the wrong logic and language.               
In this unit, you will learn about the different                 
types of fallacies writers commit, as well as know how to avoid committing them yourself. 
 
 

 

Objectives  
 

In this unit, you should be able to: 
 

● identify key concepts involving fallacies; 
● identify and use logical fallacies; and   
● judge the relevance and worth of ideas, soundness of author’s reasoning, and the 

effectiveness of the presentation.

Lesson 1: What Is a Logical Fallacy? 
   

 
People are gifted with the ability of speech, but it does not                       
mean that we are always able to use it effectively.                   
Sometimes, humans as we are, we say some things that we                     
have never thought much about and we end up causing                   
misunderstandings among people or hurting others. Thus,             
it is important that we become aware of how sensible our                     
arguments are. In this lesson you will learn about fallacies. 
 

 

Warm-up!  
 

Can you recall something that your parents or your siblings told you that you found hard to                                 
believe or understand? Why do you think does it not make sense to you? Share your                               
experience with your seatmate.

When people state ​arguments​, they give a reason or                 
set of reasons in order to persuade others that an                   
action or idea is right or wrong.  

 
However, sometimes, writers commit mistakes in           
forming their arguments. These errors are called             
fallacies​. They can either be committed deliberately in               
order to deceive or persuade people to do something,                 
or unintentionally if the person is not aware of it.  

 
 

 
Copyright ​©​ 2018 Quipper Limited    3 



 
 
 

 
 
There are two types of fallacies--​formal and ​informal​. Formal fallacy refers to the mistake in                             
the logical structure of the argument, especially if the ​premise​, or an assertion, belief, or                             
assumption, does not logically connect with the ​conclusion​. If this happens, the ​validity                         
diminishes.  

 
Informal fallacy, on the other hand, is a flaw in the relationships between the argument and                               
the supporting evidence, usually committed by faulty use of language or by unwise use of                             
irrelevant information. 
 
Below is an example of a formal fallacy: 
 

Premise 1: Some men are intelligent. 
Premise 2: Peter is a man. 
Conclusion: Therefore, Peter is intelligent. 

 
In this example, the conclusion is clearly not correct                 
because in Premise 1, it says “Some”, therefore, we                 
cannot be completely sure that Peter is intelligent even                 
if he is certainly a man. 
 
Below is an example of an informal fallacy: 
 

“I will not vote for Clarissa as our president because she comes from a broken family 
and her grade in math is even lower than mine.” 

 
This is an example of an informal fallacy because (1) the language used by the writer is an                                   
attack or unjust critique on Clarissa’s reputation or competence without really knowing her                         
completely, and (2) because the supporting reasons are not valid enough for someone to be                             
discredited to become a president. Maybe it would be more logical if the writer states                             
Clarissa’s lack of achievements in her previous term as a more viable reason not to elect her                                 
as president.

Lesson 2: Fallacies of Logos 
   

 
One of the ways a writer persuades his/her audience to                   
believe in his/her point is through the use of sound and                     
valid arguments and supporting evidence. This kind of               
appeal is called logos. However, sometimes writers fail to                 
give reasonable arguments which misleads the audience             
and affects the credibility of the writer.

Slippery slope  Exaggerates the consequence 
of an event as though it is 
catastrophic, when in fact, it is 
not that dangerous 
 
 

“If we include lessons on 
romantic relationships in

students will become

“I got healed of my migraine 
because I took a shower thrice 
today.” 

Hasty generalization  Evidence is insufficient in 
order to make such a 
conclusion 

“That beach resort must really

visitors for the two times we 
went there.” 

Non-sequitur (It doesn’t 
follow) 

Illogical connection between

Read the sample text below: 
 

“Men ought not to swear profanely, ​because it is wrong​.                   
It is wrong for the reason that it is contrary to the Moral                         
Law, and it is contrary to the Moral Law because it is                       
contrary to the Scriptures. It is contrary to the Scriptures                   
because it is contrary to the will of God, and we know it is                           
contrary to God's will ​because it is wrong​.” 

 
 
This is an example of circular reasoning because it starts                   
with the argument that swearing profanely is “wrong”.               
However, it does not explain clearly why it is wrong other                     
than how it violates doctrines and God’s will. It simply ends                     
with exactly the same argument that it should not be done                     
because it is “wrong.” It would have been better, for                   
example, if the writer mentioned how swearing profanely               
can hurt other people’s feelings compared to just simply                 
saying “it is contrary to the Scriptures.”

Lesson 3: Fallacies of Ethos 
   

 
Sometimes, writers convince people about their credibility             
by emphasizing on their own character and reputation as a                   
writer. This is called ​ethos​. However, some writers overdo                 
this to the point that people end up just focusing on the                       
writer’s merits and not on the validity of the argument                   
itself. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Share your answer to the following questions: 
 

1. Who are your favorite writers? 
2. Why do you like reading their work? 
3. Do you believe everything that they write? Why/why not? 

 

 
 
Learn About It!  
 

 
When people depend so much on their trust and respect for the 
writer’s character and reputation, the ​fallacy of ethos​ can be 
committed. The following are common examples:

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Appeal to authority  Readers are persuaded to 
believe in an argument just 
because an expert believed 
so, even if the argument is not 
really logical. 

A consumer patronizes Brand 
X toothpaste just because a 
dentist from a top hospital in 
the country claims that Brand 
X toothpaste is the best. 

Appeal to person  Attack on the person’s 
character, situation, and 
actions, and not on the 
argument itself 

“Your ideas about how to 
make our economy rise are 
questionable since you just 
came from a rural area and 
know nothing about 
industrialization.” 

Strawperson  Argument is treated 
simplistically then it is 
attacked because of how 
“shallow” it is  

People who don't support 
same-sex marriage hate 
homosexuals. 

 
 
Read the excerpt below from ​Julius Caesar​ by William Shakespeare: 
 
Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears; 
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. 
The evil that men do lives after them; 
The good is oft interred with their bones: 
So let it be with Cæsar! ​The Noble Brutus 
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious. 
If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it. 
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest— 
For Brutus is an honorable man, 
 
So are they all, all honorable men— 
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral. 
He was my friend, faithful and just to me: 
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man. 
He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: 
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? 
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept; 
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: 
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious; 
And Brutus is an honorable man. 
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, 
I thrice presented him a kingly crown, 
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? 
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious; 
And sure, he is an honorable man. 
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, 
But here I am to speak what I do know. 
You all did love him once, not without cause; 
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him? 
Oh, judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, 
And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; 
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
Notice how Antony, in one of the greatest orations known in literature, repeated his sarcasm                             
that “Brutus is an honorable man” for killing Julius Caesar because “he was ambitious”. Antony                             
clearly attacks Brutus’ character, ​an appeal to person, and not the actual argument about                           
why it is reasonably wrong that Brutus killed a man, regardless if he is the great Julius Caesar.                                   
He could have simply argued about how merciless and unjust it is to kill a man without letting                                   
him undergo a proper trial and without confirming whether he really had dangerous                         
“ambitions” that would be detrimental to the fate of the country.

Lesson 4: Fallacies of Pathos 
   

One of the easiest ways to persuade a person to believe in                       
a writer’s point of view is by appealing to his/her emotions,                     
or what is called ​pathos​. However, since this is based on                     
feelings, some reasons purely based on the heart and not                   
on the mind may not make sense and may mislead people                     
to make wrong judgments. 
 

 
Warm-up!  
 

Choose 3 advertisements from the newspapers that promote products that you actually use                         
and bring it to class. Share with your seatmate these ads and tell them what specific words                                 
enticed you to buy the product. 
 
 

 

Learn About It!  
 

When people make illogical arguments because they largely appeal to the emotions of the                           
readers, a ​fallacy of pathos can be committed. The following are its common types and their                               
examples: 
 

Type of Fallacy  Definition  Example 

Argument to the people  Appeals to the reader’s values 
and beliefs for them to accept 
an idea 
 
Entices people to believe the 
same thing just because many 
people believe in it too 

An advertisement for a 
condominium claims that only 
people with sophistication and 
good taste choose their 
condominiums.

Argument from ignorance  Persuades people to believe in 
something just because there 
was no evidence for or against 
it that exists 

“Doppelgangers do not really 
exist because I haven’t seen 
any yet.” 

Argument to pity  Appeals for the reader’s pity 
for his/her deplorable 
situation 

“Please do not put me in 
prison; I only stole those 
phones because my children 
do not have anything to eat.” 

Argument by force  Uses threat or force for the 
people to believe in an idea 

“If you do not stop arguing 
against my answer to the 
question, I’ll give you a 
surprise quiz!” 

Appeal to traditional wisdom  Continuing to believe in a 
practice or belief simply 
because it has been part of 
the culture for a long time 

“Burning of widows should not 
be stopped because it has 
been the practice in this 
village for many centuries 
now.” 

Appeal to common practice  Being convinced in doing the 
same thing most people do 
simply because it has been 
done for a long time 

“I bribe policemen every time I 
get caught violating rules 
because it has been a habit for 
many drivers ever since.” 

Red herring  Evading the issue by diverting 
the attention of the reader to 
another issue or topic 

“Stop accusing me of 
corruption. Have you not 
noticed how many resorts and 
parks I have built for this town 
in just a matter of 3 years?”

My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar, 
And I must pause till it come back to me. [Weeps.] 
 
 
Aside from fallacies of ethos with Antony’s attack on Brutus’ character, this text is also loaded                               
with many ​appeals to pity and appeal to the values of the people of Rome​. Again, instead                                 
of focusing on how unreasonable it is that Julius Caesar was killed without proper                           
investigation and trial, Antony opted to enumerate what good Caesar has done to the people                             
so that people could consider him “an honorable man”, discrediting what Brutus had thought                           
of Caesar’s character that led him to assassinate him. However, when one digs in deeper,                             
what he mentioned are not the only indications that a person is indeed “honorable” and not                               
“ambitious”. Instead of focusing on the illogicality and mercilessness of Brutus’ action, he                         
appealed to the loyalty and love of the people for Caesar for them to be angry with the brutal                                     
murder of their leader. These are not enough reasons to bring Caesar’s death to justice.
