      "Learn about It!Types of MonologueSoliloquyA** soliloquy** is a monologue that shows the character talking loudly to himself at length. In a soliloquy, the audience and at times the figures present in that particular scene can hear what the character says, but he is unaware of those who can overhear him.An example of a soliloquy is the Balcony scene in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”:“O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name;Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.”Dramatic MonologueAdramatic monologueis a formal or informal speech that the character gives directly to the audience or another character. In a dramatic monologue, the character reveals his traits and intentions that is relevant to the plot of the story.An example of a dramatic monologue is Robert Browning’s “The Last Duchess”:She hadA heart—how shall I say?— too soon made glad,Too easily impressed; she liked whate’erShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.Internal MonologueAninternal monologueis usually found in written texts such as novels and short stories or in television and movies where the character’s thoughts are exposed. Through internal monologue (also known as “stream of consciousness”), the readers can see what is going through the character’s mind. In writing, internal monologues can be identified through italicized texts; and in TV and movies, internal monologue can be described as the audience “hearing the character’s thoughts”.Report errors \n",

      "ExamplesRead the excerpt below from James Joyce’s story, “Araby”. From the details, what can we say about what the narrator feels about the girl?...If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother into his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side.Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.Report errors \n",

An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister.When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ash pits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas.Why was the priest considered a charitable person?Who recently passed away as described by the narrator?What season makes days shorter?Report errors \n",

He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude.\"There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,\" said Goodman Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, \"What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!\"Report errors \n",

And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown.\"Dearest heart,\" whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear, \"prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night.
