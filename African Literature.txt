Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6

suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

14
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

15

Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry
(from a heroic poem dedicated to the Zulu chief Shaka)

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
Others disappearing into the heavens!
Son of Menzi!
Viper of Ndaba!
Erect, ready to strike,
It strikes the shields of men!
Father of the cock!
Why did it disappear over the mountains?

It annihilated men!
That is Shaka,
Son of Senzangakhona,
Of whom it is said, Bayede!
You are an elephant!

Questions:

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

The T-Chart

With a partner, go to the library and read about modern African literature (e.g., themes and
characteristics). You have exactly 25 minutes to conduct a short research and take down
notes. Do not forget to cite your source(s). Write your notes on the left-hand column of the
T-chart below. Read your notes again and sum them up in the right-hand column. Present
your work in front of the class.

Notes Summary

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.

2. According to Ali A. Mazrui, what are the seven major themes used in African literature

produced after the colonization?

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

10

This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that

Lesson 4: Modern African Literature
The educational systems imposed by colonialism gave rise to
modern African literature. This is the reason why modern African
literature has both native African and European influences. This
lesson will help you understand modern African literature.

Warm-up!

The T-Chart

With a partner, go to the library and read about modern African literature (e.g., themes and
characteristics). You have exactly 25 minutes to conduct a short research and take down
notes. Do not forget to cite your source(s). Write your notes on the left-hand column of the
T-chart below. Read your notes again and sum them up in the right-hand column. Present
your work in front of the class.

Notes Summary

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance
g. the clash between Africanity and humanity

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe

For a more in-depth knowledge of modern African literature, try to read Chinua Achebe’s

21

Things Fall Apart. This novel, which was published in 1958, has been recognized as the finest
novel written about life in Nigeria at the end of 19th century. It is also considered as the most
widely read African novel. The novel is structured in three parts.

When reading this novel, take note of the setting and society, character and conflict, themes,
motifs, use of imagery, structure, technique, and language.

African Literature

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Check Your Understanding

1. What makes Africa a multicultural continent?
2. How would you describe traditional African music?
3. What is a  griot?
4. What are the features of traditional African storytelling?
5. In your own words, explain this sentence: “African literature is oral in nature.”

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as

Learn about It!

The modern experience of Africa comes from the traumatic
colonial violence of the West and the struggles toward national
identity. This is at the heart of African modernity. Modern African
writing serves as a movement toward the restoration and
rediscovery of African culture and thinking.

Postcolonial Africa

As African countries gained independence, there came a struggle
for their national identity. This was one of the main features of
African writing. In the modern times, African writers drew
inspiration largely from their experiences after the colonization of
Africa.

Major Themes Used in Modern African Literature

According to Ali A. Mazrui, a writer and professor on African studies, there are seven major
themes used in African literature produced after the colonization:

a. the clash between Africa’s past and present
b. the clash between tradition and modernity
c. the clash between indigenous and foreign
d. the clash between individualism and community
e. the clash between socialism and capitalism
f. the clash between development and self-reliance

Well-Known Literary Pieces of Modern African Literature

Modern African literature became prominent as a literary
tradition, producing classics such as Chinua Achebe’s
Things Fall Apart, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s Weep Not Child, and
Wole Soyinka’s Death and the King’s Horseman. This
recognition was further affirmed by Soyinka’s winning of
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986.

Modern African Literature in Terms of Language and Style

The colonization of Africa exposed African writers to some European languages, which they
then used in their works. Modern African literature is written using both native African and
European languages.

Though written African literature is more dominant in modern literature, oral lore or literature
is not lost. Up to this day, literary works of the ethnic groups Yoruba, Hausa, Zulu, and Sotho
in native languages still exist.

Because of colonialism, African literature is heavily influenced by the West in terms of both
style and language use. Writers such as Mazisi Kunene, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the late Okot
p’Bitek first wrote some of their works in African languages before translating them into
English. It is common, however, for many African writers to write in languages such as
Portuguese and French as well.

There is the Eurocentric temptation to see modern African literature written in these
European languages as an extension of European literature. It goes to show that the West is a
major factor in the literary production of Africa. Eurocentrism appears to propagate a trend
that to be modern is to be Western. However, after modern imperialism, language alone
cannot be the sole criterion of a people’s literature.

African Literature

Learn about It!

Geographically, Africa is the second largest continent at almost
12 million square miles. It houses a variety of ethnic groups,
and there are more than a thousand languages, which makes
Africa a multicultural continent.

One of its earliest civilizations is that of Egypt, which was
established more than 5,000 years ago. This civilization sprang
in the lands beside the Nile River.

As it had different ethnic groups, it also has various religious
systems, many of which are polytheistic with a supreme god
and other lesser gods and deities. Ancient Africans also
believed in and prayed to ancestral spirits.

With the onset of foreign trade and cultural exchanges, Christianity was brought to Ethiopia in
the early fourth century, while Islam came to northern Africa in the early seventh century. This
affected the outlook and perspectives of people in Africa.

Characteristics of Traditional African Music

As with other cultures, Africa also has its own style of music. These are:

a. Polyrhythmic – African music featured complex, interlocking, and contrasting rhythms
that are achieved by striking bells, clapping hands, beating drums, and stomping feet.
Other instruments used in traditional African music include gongs, harp-type
instruments, flutes, and types of xylophone, among others.

b. Call and response – This refers to the act of having a chorus repeat a lead singer’s
words in response.

5

African Ritualistic Dances

The primitive African people love to perform ritualistic dances. These dances are often
witnessed in important occasions like:

a. events in the agricultural year
b. rituals that mark rites of passage
c. ceremonies of secret societies
d. healing the sick

Oral Literature

Unlike Western cultures that are associated with advanced forms of writing, African literature
is oral in nature, meaning it has to be recited and even performed. Literature is not accessed
through books but through storytellers who pass on epics, poems, and narratives from their
memory. This is why in discussing African literature, it is natural to discuss dance, music, and
other performances.

In Western Africa, the griot is a learned
storyteller, poet, performer, and historian.
Griots have been handing down their oral
culture for over 4,000 years. Griots accompany
their stories with music. It takes much effort and
training and a long time (several years) for them
to familiarize themselves with the numerous
traditional songs, rhythms, and melodies.

Features of Traditional African Storytelling

Traditional African storytelling is a unique experience. This is characterized by the following:

a. It is a communal experience. As such, everybody belonging to traditional African
societies takes part in storytelling. Even the listeners or audience play a vital role, as
they participate and make the storytelling interactive. Storytelling in Africa is so
interactive, in fact, that the audience often shapes the story, offering their own

6
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



suggestions or interpretations.
b. Repetition is an important part of the storytelling. The storyteller may repeat

stanzas, words, or phrases, and the audience may repeat those words back to the
storyteller as well when doing “call and response.” This act of repetition makes it easy to
understand the stories as well as to remember them.

c. Storytelling fulfills purposes beyond being just a form of entertainment. It is a way
for Africans to enrich their culture as well as pass it on. Through storytelling, they are
able to keep traditions alive, teach the youth about codes of conduct, and maintain
social order.

d. Tone is a vital part of the storytelling. The way the speaker says a word or statement
affects its meaning. As such, how something is said is just as important—if not more—
as what is said when doing traditional African storytelling.

Check Your Understanding

1. What makes Africa a multicultural continent?
2. How would you describe traditional African music?
3. What is a  griot?
4. What are the features of traditional African storytelling?
5. In your own words, explain this sentence: “African literature is oral in nature.”

African Prose Writing

Prose-writing is continuous yet systematic. In other words,
prose best reflects the organized mind, which is evident in
stories and essays. In Africa, prose is often used to narrate
social memories, rules, and history.

African prose narratives often center on people, animals,
histories, etc. For animal narratives, the plot usually focuses on
large animals tricked by smaller ones. Such narratives are
called trickster stories. Another plot focuses on an attacker
(e.g., snake or crocodile) that is trying to deceive its rescuer or
savior (e.g., child, white man, rat) but is instead outsmarted by
a third character (e.g., hare, jackal, spider). The third character
foils the attacker into a trap.

Empires and Societies that Contributed to the Enrichment of African Prose

Various empires and societies contributed to the enrichment of African prose. These are as
follows:

1. Egypt – This country had a vibrant and strong empire that centered on a polytheistic
society. The Egyptians influenced African prose by writing myths that honored their
gods. One of the greatest contributions of early Egyptians is hieroglyphics, an ancient
system of writing.

2. Ghana Empire – It is a powerful and affluent kingdom that derives its riches from the
trade of salt and gold.

3. Mali Empire – It overtook Ghana Empire for supremacy.
4. Songhai – This is the last of the great kingdoms.
5. Timbuktu – This is a city that was part of both the Mali and Songhai empires. It served

as a major trading center and was home to libraries with extensive collections of books.

10
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



This allowed its people to preserve narratives and leave great contributions to both
literature and civilization.

6. Fasa and Aksum – These are African territories with notable oral literature. These were
civilized societies that became very influential among cultural formations in the
northern areas of Africa. They were prominent because they were exposed to a variety
of cultures from both the East (India) and West (Rome).

Oral Traditions

The majority of African narratives are oral. There are two prominent oral traditions in Africa:

1. Dilemma tale - This is a form of moral tale that does not have a definite ending and
invites the audience to share judgment. It is intended to start discussions regarding
moral issues and may be used as a form of instruction or entertainment.

2. Chain tale or cumulative tale – It is a formulaic story, which means it has a pattern. In
this kind of story, the characters’ dialogue or action repeats, and the plot line tends to
be simple. It often contains hilarious messages in the form of jokes and witty
statements.

Literary Devices

Aside from the two prominent oral traditions, African prose also made use of many different
literary devices. Among the commonly used literary devices in African prose are: parallelism,
personification, metaphor, alliteration, and rhyme. Other literary devices used in African
prose include:

1. Epithet -  This is often used to describe particular traits or qualities of a character.
2. Apostrophe - This is a literary device used to address a character who is not present or

a nonliving object. It is often represented with an exclamation point.
3. Omniscient point of view - This is a narration method wherein the narrator is aware

of all the characters’ thoughts and feelings.

Prominent African Authors

Below are authors who have made significant contributions to African prose:

1. Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford, a Ghanaian, is the author of one of the first
published African novels written in English. His novel is titled Ethiopia Unbound. He was
also a political activist, and he wrote books that served to convey his opposition to the
various laws imposed by the British on land management.

2. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo, a South African, wrote the first published English
language African play titled The Girl Who Killed to Save. He was also the founder of the
Bantu Dramatic Society, the establishment of which led to the creation of many plays.

3. Ngugi wa Thiong’o, a Kenyan writer, wrote the first full-length East African play titled
Black Hermit. A versatile writer, he wrote essays, plays, novels, and short stories, some
of which were political while some were considered children’s literature.

4. Chinua Achebe, a Nigerian, wrote the novel Things Fall Apart, which is regarded as one
of the most influential African novels and has received worldwide critical acclaim.

Lesson 3: African Poetry
In the previous lesson, we discussed African prose. Now, we are
going to discuss its counterpart—African poetry. This lesson will
help you understand the features of African poetry.

Warm-up!

Triad Activity

Form a group of three. Choose one African poem from the internet or other print sources.
Analyze your group’s chosen poem and answer the guide questions below. When presenting
the poem in class, one member should read it aloud, and the other two members should
answer the guide questions and share the group’s insights about the chosen poem.

Guide questions:

1. Consider the title of the poem. Does it say something about the poem’s subject?
2. What is the theme or central idea of this poem?
3. Are there any symbols? What do these symbols mean?
4. Does the poem appeal to the reader’s intellect, emotions, or reason?
5. What do you think is the poem’s purpose?

Learn about It!

Danilo Francisco M. Reyes, a poet and teacher, once said that
“a poem is an answer to an unsaid question.” In the context of
African poetry, a poem is the response to the experiences of
the African race, which includes their experience of god in
nature, the violence of colonialism, and the struggles of

14
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



postcolonial life. Poetry’s ability to show different imageries with various meanings makes
African poetry a rich source of African sentiments.

African Poetry

African poetry, just like its counterpart, prose, is generally oral. Often, it is sung and
performed. Forms of African poetry include praise poems for leaders and other prominent
people, ritual verse, occupational verse, and the narrative epic. They also had songs about
love, marriage, and war, as well as lullabies and incantations.

Two famous African epics in the precolonial era are the Epic of Sundiata, which was composed
in medieval Mali, and the Epic of Dinga, which was from the Ghana Empire.

Because Africa is a continent that houses more than 8,000 languages, there are five major
language families used in African poetry. These are as follows:

a. Afro-Asiatic languages
b. Click languages
c. Niger-Congo languages
d. Sudanic languages
e. Austronesian languages

African Poets

Many African writers had significant contributions in the quality of African poems. These
writers include:

1. Leopold Sedar Senghor was a president of Senegal who published the first anthology of
French language poetry. French was popularly used by the local intellectuals because of the
strong influence of their French colonizers. His work was titled Anthology of the New Black and
Malagasy Poetry in the French Language. He, along with Léon Damas of French Guiana and
Aimé Césaire of Martinique, was also one of the initiators of Negritude, a literary and
cultural movement that started in the 1930s and continued into the 1950s.

15
Copyright © 2018 Quipper Limited



Negritude

Negritude promoted the self-affirmation of the black people.
Works inspired by Negritude glorified Africa and promoted
pride in the African heritage. Among the poems showing
Negritude are Abioseh Nicol’s “The Meaning of Africa,” David
Diop’s “Africa,” and Bernard Dadié’s “I Thank You God.”

2. Wole Soyinka is a Nigerian poet who was well-known for his
utilization of English in writing poetry. In 1986, he became a Nobel
Prize laureate for literature. He was the first African who won the
award. Most of his poems depict racial discrimination.

3. Nadine Gordimer is the second African writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1991. She is a playwright and a poet. Her writing discusses apartheid or the racial
discrimination system in South Africa.

4. Another influential poet is John Pepper Clark, a Nigerian literary critic. His famous
collection of poems was called A Decade of Tongues, which reflected on postcolonial life in
Africa.

Below is an example of African poetry. Read the poem and try to answer the questions that
follow.

Heroic Poetry

Hero who surpasses other heroes!
Swallow that disappears in the clouds,
